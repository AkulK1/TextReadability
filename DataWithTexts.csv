0,Little Bear,"Minarik, Else Holmelund",b002_LittleBear.txt,1,"“Mother Bear, Mother Bear, Where are you?” calls Little Bear. “Oh, dear, Mother Bear is not here, and today is my birthday. “I think my friends will come, but I do not see a birthday cake. My goodness – no birthday cake. What can I do? The pot is by the fire. The water in the pot is hot. If I put something in the water, I can make Birthday Soup. All my friends like soup. Let me see what we have. We have carrots and potatoes, peas and tomatoes; I can make soup with carrots, potatoes, peas and tomatoes.” So Little Bear begins to make soup in the big black pot. First, Hen comes in. “Happy Birthday, Little Bear,” she says. “Thank you, Hen,” says Little Bear. Hen says, “My! Something smells good here. Is it in the big black pot?” “Yes,” says Little Bear, “I am making Birthday Soup. Will you stay and have some?” “Oh, yes, thank you,” says Hen. And she sits down to wait. Next, Duck comes in. “Happy Birthday, Little bear,” says Duck. “My, something smells good. Is it in the big black pot?” “Thank you, Duck,” says Little Bear. “Yes, I am making Birthday Soup. Will you stay and have some with us?” “Thank you, yes, thank you,” says Duck. And she sits down to wait. Next, Cat comes in. “Happy Birthday, Little Bear,” he says. “Thank you, Cat,” says Little Bear. “I hope you like Birthday Soup. I am making Birthday Soup. Cat says, “Can you really cook? If you can really make it, I will eat it.” “Good,” says Little Bear. “The Birthday Soup is hot, so we must eat it now. We cannot wait for Mother Bear. I do not know where she is.” “Now, here is some soup for you, Hen,” says Little Bear. “And here is some soup for you, Duck, and here is some soup for you, Cat, and here is some soup for me. Now we can all have some Birthday Soup.” Cat sees Mother Bear at the door, and says, “Wait, Little Bear. Do not eat yet. Shut your eyes, and say one, two, three.” Little Bear shuts his eyes and says, “One, two, three.” Mother Bear comes in with a big cake. “Now, look,” says Cat. “Oh, Mother Bear,” says Little Bear, “what a big beautiful Birthday Cake! Birthday Soup is good to eat, but not as good as Birthday Cake. I am so happy you did not forget.” “Yes, Happy Birthday, Little Bear!” says Mother Bear. “This Birthday Cake is a surprise for you. I never did forget your birthday, and I never will.”"
1,Are You My Mother?,"Eastman, P. D.",b003_AreYouMyMother.txt,1,"A mother bird sat on her egg.
The egg jumped!
“Oh my!” said mother bird.  “My baby will be here!  He will want to eat!!  I must get him something!”
So away she went.

The egg jumped.  Out came the baby bird!
“Where is my mother?”  he said.  He looked for her.
He looked up / down – did not see her.
“I will go and look for her.”  So away he went.

He came to a kitten. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the kitten.  The kitten just looked and looked.  He did not say a thing.  The kitten was not his mother, so he went on. 

He came to a dog. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the dog.
“I am not your mother.  I am a dog,” said the dog.

The kitten was not his mother.  The dog was not his mother.  So the baby bird went on. 

He came to a cow. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the cow. 
“How could I be your mother?” said the cow.  “I am a cow.”

The kitten was not his mother.  The dog was not his mother.  The cow was not his mother.  Did he have a mother?

“I do have a mother,” said the baby bird.  “I have to find her!”

The baby bird passed a red car.  Could that thing be his mother? 
Then he saw a boat sailing along.  “There she is!  Mother!”  He called out to the boat.  But the boat did not stop. 
He looked up and saw a plane.  “Here I am, Mother!”  But the plane did not stop. 

Then the baby bird saw a big blue thing could toward him.  This must be his mother!  He ran right up to it.  “Mother!  Mother!  Here I am, Mother!”  But the big thing just said “Snort!”
“You are not my mother.  You are a Snort.  I have to get out of here!”
But the baby bird could not get away.  The snort went up and started moving.  But where was the Snort going? 

“Where am I?” said the baby bird.  “I want to go home!  I want my mother!”
Just then the Snort dropped the baby bird back into the nest.  The baby bird was home!  Just then mother bird came back. 

“Do you know who I am?” she said to her baby.
“Yes, I know who you are.  You are not a kitten.  You are not a dog.  You are not a cow.  You are not a boat, a plane, or a snort.  You are a bird, and you are my mother!”

4,Frog and Toad Together,"Lobel, Arnold.",b006_FrogAndToadTogether.txt,1,"One morning Toad sat in the bed. “I have many things to do,” he said. “I will have many things to do,” he said. “I will write them all down on a list so that I can remember them.” Toad wrote down in a piece of paper: A List o things to do today Then he wrote: Wake up “I have done that,” said Toad and he crossed out: Wake Up Then Toad wrote other things on the paper. A list of things to do today Wake Up Eat Breakfast Get dressed Go to Frog’s house Take walk with Frog Eat lunch Take nap Play game with Frog Eat supper Go to sleep “There ,” said Toad. “Now my day is all written down.” He got out of bed and had something to eat. Then Toad crossed out: Eat Breakfast Toad took his clothes out of the closet and put them on. Then he crossed out: Get dressed Toad put the list in his pocket. He opened the door and walked out into the morning. Soon toad was at frog’s front door. He took the list from his pocket and crossed out: Go to Frog’s house Toad knocked at the door. “Hello,” said Frog. “Look at my list of things to do,” said Toad. “Oh,” said Frog, “that is very nice.” Toad said, “My list tells me that we will go for a walk.” “All right,” said Frog. “I am ready.” Frog and Toad went on a long walk. Then Toad took the list from his pocket again. He crossed out: Take walk with Frog Just then there was a strong wind. It blew the list Out of Toad’s hand. The list blew high up into the air. “Help!” cried Toad. “My list is blowing away. What will I do without my list?” “Hurry!” said Frog. “We will run and catch it.” “No!” shouted Toad. “I cannot do that.” “Why not?” asked Frog. “Because,” wailed Toad, “running after my list in not one of the things that I wrote on my list of things to do!” Frog ran after the list. He ran over hills and swamps, but the list blew on and on. At last Frog came back to Toad. “I am sorry,” gasped Frog, “but I could not catch your list,” “Blah,” said Toad.”I cannot remember any of the things that were on my list of things to do. I will just have to sit there and do nothing,” said Toad. Toad sat and did nothing. Frog sat with him. After a long time Frog said, “Toad, it is getting dark. We should be going to sleep now.” “Go to sleep!” shouted Toad. “That was the last thing on my list!” Toad wrote on the ground with a stick: Go to sleep. Then he crossed out: Go to sleep. “There,” said Toad. “Now my day is all crossed out!” “I am glad,” said Frog. Then Frog and Toad went right to sleep. THE GARDEN Frog was in his garden. Toad came walking by. “What a fine garden you have, Frog,” he said. “Yes,” said Frog. “It is very nice, but it was hard work.” “I wish I had a garden,” said Toad. “Here are some flower seeds. Plant them in the ground,” said Frog, “and soon you will have a garden.” “How soon?” asked Toad. “Quite soon,” said Frog. Toad ran home. He planted the flower seeds. “Now seeds,” said Toad, “start growing.” Toad walked up and down a few times. The seeds did not start to grow. Toad put his head close to the ground and said loudly, “Now seeds, start growing!” Toad looked at the ground again. The seeds did not start to grow. Toad put his head very close to the ground and shouted “NOW SEEDS, START GROWING!” Frog came running up the path. “What is all this noise,” he asked. “My seeds will not grow,” said Toad. “You are shouting too much,” said Frog. “These poor seeds are afraid to grow. “My seeds are afraid to grow?” asked Toad. “Of course,” said Frog. “Leave them alone for a few days. Let the sun shine on them, let the rain fall on them. Soon your seeds will start to grow.” That night Toad looked out his window. “Drat!” said Toad. “My seeds have not started to grow. They must be afraid of the dark.” Toad went out to his garden with some candles. “I will read the seeds a story,” said Toad. “Then they will not be afraid.” Toad read a long story to his seeds. All the next day Toad sang songs to his seeds. And all the next day Toad read poems to his seeds. And all the next day Toad played music for his seeds. Toad looked at the ground. The seeds still did not start to grow. “What shall I do?” cried Toad. “These must be most frightened seeds in the whole world!” Then Toad felt vey tired, and he fell asleep. “Toad, Toad, wake up,” said Frog. “Look at your garden!” Toad looked at his garden. Little green plants were Coming up out of the ground. “At last shouted Toad, “my seeds have stopped being afraid to grow!” “And now you will have a nice garden too.” Said Frog. “It was very hard work.” COOKIES Toad baked some cookies. “These cookies smell very good,” said Toad. He ate one. “And they taste even better,” he said. Toad ran to Frog’s house. “Frog, Frog,” cried Toad, “taste this cookies that I made.” Frog at one of the cookies. “These are the best cookies I have ever eaten!” said Frog. Frog and Toad ate many cookies, one after another. “You know, Toad,” said Frog, with his mouth full, “I think we should stop eating. We will soon be sick.” “You are right,” said Toad. “Let us eat one last cookie, and then we will stop.” Frog and Toad ate one last cookie. There were many cookies left in the bowl. “Frog,” said Toad, “let us eat one very last cookie, and then we will stop.” Frog and Toad ate one very last cookie. “We must stop eating!” cried Toad as he ate another. “Yes,” said Frog, reaching for a cookie, “we need will power.” “What is will power?” asked Toad. “Will power is trying hard not to do something that really want to do,” said Frog. “You mean like trying not to eat all of these cookies?” asked Toad. “Right,” said Frog. Frog put the cookies in a box. “There,” he said. “Now we will note eat any more cookies.” “But we can open the box,” said Toad. “That is true,” said Frog. Frog got a ladder. He put the box up on high shelf. “There,” said Frog. “Now we will not eat any more cookie.” “But we can climb the ladder and take the box down from the shelf and cut the string and open the box,” said Toad. “That is true,” said Frog. Frog climbed the ladder and took the box down from the shelf. He cuts the string and opened the box. Frog took the box outside. He shouted in a loud voice, “HEY BIRDS. HERE ARE COOKIES!” Birds came from everywhere. They picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away. “Now we have no more cookies to eat,” said Toad sadly. “Not even one,” “Yes,” said Frog, “but we have lots of will power.” “You may keep it all, Frog,” said Toad. “I am going home now to bake a cake.” DRAGONS AND GIANTS Frog and Toad were reading a book together. “The people in this book are brave,” said Toad. “They fight dragons and giants, and they are never afraid,! “I wonder if we are brave,” said Frog. Frog and Toad looked into a mirror. “We look brave,” said Frog. “Yes, but are we?” asked Toad. Frog and Toad went outside. “We can try to climb this mountain,” said Frog. “That should tell us if we are brave. Frog went leaping over rocks, and Toad came puffing up behind him. They came to a dark cave. A big snake came out of the cave. “Hello lunch,” said the snake when he saw Frog and Toad. He opened his wide mouth. Frog and Toad jumped away. Toad was shaking. “I am not afraid!” he cried. They climbed higher, and they heard a loud noise. Many large stones were rolling down the mountain. “It’s an avalanche!” cried Toad. Frog and Toad jumped away. Frog was trembling. “I am not afraid!” he shouted. They came to the top of the mountain. The shadow of a hawk fell over them. Frog and Toad jumped under a rock. The hawk flew away. “We are not afraid!” screamed Frog and Toad at the same time. Then they ran down the mountain very fast. They ran past the place where they sae the snake. They ran all the way to Toad’s house. “Frog, I am glad to have a brave friend like you,” said Toad. He jumped into the bed and pulled the covers over his head. “And I am happy to have a brave friend like you, Toad,” said Frog. He jumped into the closet and shut the door. Toad stayed in the bed, and Frog stayed in the closet. They stayed there for a long time, just feeling very brave together. THE DREAM Toad was asleep, and he was having a dream. He was on a stage, and he was wearing a costume. Toad was looking into the dark. Frog was sitting in the theatre. A strange voice from far away said, “PRESENTING THE GREATEST TOAD IN THE WORLD!” Toad took a deep bow. Frog looked smaller as he shouted, “Hooray for Toad!” “TOAD WILL NOW PLAY THE PIANO VERY WELL,” said the strange voice. Toad played the piano, and he did not a note. “Frog,” cried Toad, “can you play the piano like this?” “No,” said Frog. It seemed to Toad that Frog looked even smaller. “TOAD WILL NOW WALK ON A HIGH WIRE, AND HE WILL NOT FALL DOWN,” said the voice. Toad walked on the high wire. “Frog,” cried toad, “can you do tricks like this?” “No,” peeped Frog, who looked very, very small. “TOAD WILL NOW DANCE, AND HE WILL BE WONDERFUL,” said the voice. “Frog, can you be as wonderful as this?” said Toad as he danced all over the stage. There was no answer. Toad looked out into the theatre. Frog was so small that he could not be seen or heard. “Frog, what have I done?” cried Toad. Then the voice said”THE GREATEST TOAD WILL NOW..,” “Shut up!” screamed toad. “Frog, Frog, where have you gone?” Toad was spinning in the dark. “Come back frog,” he shouted. “I will be lonely!” “I am right here” said Frog. Frog was standing near Toad’s bed. “Wake up, Toad” he said. “Frog is that really you?” said Frog. “And you your own right size?” asked Toad. “Yes, I think so,” said Frog. Toad looked at sunshine at the sunshine coming through the window. “Frog,” he said, “I am so glad that you came over.” “I always do,” said Frog. Then Frog and Toad ate a big breakfast. And after that they spent a fine, long day together."
5,Owl at Home,"Lobel, Arnold.",b007_OwlAtHome.txt,1,"THE GUEST Owl was at home. “How good it feels to be sitting by this fire,” said Owl. “It is so cold and snowy outside.” Owl was eating buttered toast and hot pea soup for supper. Owl heard a loud sound at the front door. “Who is out there banging and pounding at my door on a night like this?” he said. Owl opened the door. No one was there. Only the snow and the wind. Owl sat near the fire again. There was another loud noise at the door. “Who can it be,” said Owl, “knocking and thumping at my door on a night like this?” Owl opened the door. No one was there. Only the snow and the cold. “The poor old winter is knocking at my door,” said Owl. “Perhaps it wants to sit by the fire. Well, I will be kind and let the winter come in.” Owl opened his door very wide. “Come in, Winter,” said Owl. “Come in and warm yourself for a while.” Winter came into the house. It came in very fast. A cold wind pushed Owl against the wall. Winter ran around the room. It blew out the fire in the fireplace. The snow whirled up the stairs and whooshed down the hallway. “Winter!” cried Owl. “You are my guest. This is no way to behave!” But Winter did not listen. It made the window shades flap and shiver. It turned the pea soup into hard, green ice. Winter went into all the rooms of Owl’s house. Soon everything was covered with snow. “You must go, Winter!” shouted Owl. “Go ways, right now!” The wind blew around and around. Then Winter rushed out and slammed the front door. “Good-bye,” called Owl, “and do not come back!” Owl made a new fire in the fireplace. The room became warm again. The snow melted away. The hard, green ice turned back into soft pea soup. Owl sat down in his chair and quietly finished his supper. Strange Bumps Owl was in bed. “It is time to blow out the candle and go to sleep,” he said with a yawn. Then Owl saw two bumps under the blanket at the bottom of his bed. “What can those strange bumps be?” asked Owl. Owl lifted up the blanket. He looked down into the bed. All he could see was darkness. Owl tried to sleep, but he could not. “What if those two strange bumps grow bigger and bigger while I am asleep?” said Owl. “That would not be pleasant.” Owl moved his right foot up and down. The bump on the right moved up and down. “One of those bumps is moving!” said Owl. Owl moved his left foot up and down. The bump on the left moved up and down. “The other bump is moving!” cried Owl. Owl pulled all of the covers off his bed. The bumps were gone. All Owl could see at the bottom of the bed were his own two feet. “But now I am cold,” said Owl. “I will cover myself with the blankets again.” As soon as he did, he way the same two bumps. “Those bumps are back!” shouted Owl. “Bumps, bumps, bumps! I will never sleep tonight!” Owl jumped up and down on top of his bed. “Where are you? What are you?” he cried. With a crash and a bang the bed came falling down. Owl ran down the stairs. He sat in his chair near the fire. “I will let those two strange bumps sit on my bed all by themselves,” said Owl. “Let them grow as big as they wish. I will sleep right here where I am safe.” And that was what he did. TEAR-WATER SEA Owl took the kettle out of the cupboard. “Tonight I will make tear-water tea,” he said. He put the kettle on his lap. “Now,” said Owl, “I will begin.” Owl sat very still. He began to think of things that were sad. “Chairs with broken legs,” said Owl. His eyes began to water. “Songs that cannot be sung,” said Owl, “because the words have been forgotten.” Owl began to cry. A large tear rolled down and dropped into the kettle. “Spoons that have fallen behind the stove and are never seen again,” said Owl. More tears dropped down into the kettle. “Books that cannot be read,” said Owl, “because some of the pages have been torn out.” “Clocks that have stopped,” said Owl, “with on one near to wind them up.” Owl was crying. Many large tears dropped into the kettle. “Mornings nobody was because everybody was sleeping,” sobbed Owl. “Mashed potatoes left on a plate,” he cried, “because no one wanted to eat them. And pencils that are too short to use.” Owl thought about many other sad things. He cried and cried. Soon the kettle was filled up with tears. “There,” said Owl. “That does it!” Owl stopped crying. He put the kettle on the stove to boil for tea. Owl felt happy as he filled his cup. “It tasted a little bit salty,” he said, “but tear-water tea is always pretty good.” UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS Owl’s house had an upstairs and a downstairs. There were twenty steps on the stairway. Some of the time Owl was upstairs in his bedroom. At other times Owl was downstairs in his living room. When Owl was downstairs he said, “I wonder how my upstairs is?” When Owl was upstairs he said, “I wonder how my downstairs is getting along? I am always missing one place or the other. There must be a way,” said Owl, “to be upstairs and to be downstairs at the same time.” “Perhaps if I run very very fast, I can be in both places at once.” Owl ran up the stairs. “I am up,” he said. Owl ran down the stairs. “I am down,” he said. Owl ran up and down the stairs faster and faster. “Owl!” he cried. “Are you downstairs?” There was no answer. “No,” said Owl. “I am not downstairs because I am upstairs. I am not running fast enough.” “Owl!” he shouted. “Are you upstairs?” There was no answer. “No,” said Owl. “I am not upstairs because I am downstairs. I must run even faster.” “Faster, faster, faster!” cried Owl. Owl ran upstairs and downstairs all evening. But he could not be in both places at once. “When I am up,” said Owl, “I am not down I am not up. All I am is very tired!” Owl sat down to rest. He sat on the tenth step because it was a place that was right in the middle. OWL AND THE MOON One night Owl went down to the seashore. He sat on a large rock and looked out at the waves. Everything was dark. Then a small tip of the moon came up over the edge of the sea. Owl watched the moon. It climbed higher and higher into the sky. Soon the whole, round moon was shining. Owl sat on the rock and looked up at the moon for a long time. “If I am looking at you, moon, then you must be looking back at me. We must be very good friends.” The moon did not answer, but Owl said, “I will come back and see you again, moon. But now I must go home.” Owl waled down the path. He looked up at the sky. The moon was still there. It was following him. “No, no moon,” said Owl. “It is kind of you to light my way. But you must stay up over the sea where you look so fine,” Owl walked on a little farther. He looked at the sky again. There was the moon coming right along with him. “Dear moon,” said Owl, “you really must not come home with me. My house is small. You would not fit through the door. And I have nothing to give you for supper.” Owl kept on walking. The moon sailed after him over the tops of the trees. “Moon,” said Owl, “I think that you do not hear me.” Owl climbed to the top of a hill. He shouted as loudly as he could, “Good-bye, moon!” The moon went behind some clouds. Owl looked and looked. The moon was gone. “It is always a little sad to say good-bye to a friend,” said Owl. Owl came home. He put on his pajamas and went to bed. The room was very dark. Owl was still feeling sad. All at once, Owl’s bedroom was filled with silver light. Owl looked out of the window. The moon was coming from behind the clouds. “Moon, you have followed me all the way home. What a good, round friend you are!” said Owl. Then Owl put his head on the p pillow and closed his eyes. The moon was shining down through the window. Owl did not feel sad at all."
6,Hi! Fly Guy,"Arnold, Tedd.",b008_HiFlyGuy.txt,1,"A fly went flying. He was looking for something to eat—something tasty, something slimy. A boy went walking He was looking for something to catch—something smart, something for The Amazing Pet Show. They met. The boy caught the fly in a jar. “A pet!” He said. The fly was mad. He wanted to be free. He stomped his foot and said—Buzz! The boy was surprised. He said, “You know my name! You are the smartest pet in the world!”"
7,A Tree Is a Plant,"Bulla, Clyde Robert.",b009_ATreeIsaPlant.txt,1,"A tree is a plant. A tree is the biggest plant that grows. Most kinds of trees grow from seeds the way most small plants do. There are many kinds of trees. Here are a few of them. How many do you know? [illustration is labeled with Maple, Conifer, Persimmon, Palms, Lemon, Willow] This tree grows in the country. It might grow in your yard, too. Do you know what kind it is? This is an apple tree. This apple tree came from a seed. The seed was small. It grew inside an apple. Have you ever seen an apple seed? Ask an adult to help you cut an apple in two. The seeds are in the center. They look like this. Most apple trees come from seeds that are planted. Sometimes an apple tree grows from a seed that falls to the ground. The wind blows leaves over the seed. The wind blows soil over the seed. All winter the seed lies under the leaves and the soil. All winter the seed lies under the ice and snow and is pushed into the ground. Spring comes. Rain falls. The sun comes out and warms the earth. The seed begins to grow. At first the young plant does not look like a tree. The tree is very small. It is only a stem with two leaves. It has no apples on it. A tree must grow up before it has apples on it. Each year the tree grows. It grows tall. In seven years it is so tall that you can stand under its branches. In the spring there are blossoms on the tree. Spring is apple-blossom time. […] We cannot see the roots. They are under the ground. Some of the roots are large. Some of them are as small as hairs. The roots grow like branches under the ground. A tree could not live without roots. Roots hold the trunk in the ground. Roots keep the tree from falling when the wind blows. Roots keep the rain from washing the tree out of the ground. Roots do something more. They take water from the ground. They carry the water into the trunk of the tree. The trunk carries the water to the branches. The branches carry the water to the leaves. Hundreds and hundreds of leaves grow on the branches. The leaves make food from water and air. They make food when the sun shines. The food goes into the branches. It goes into the trunk and roots. It goes to every part of the tree. Fall comes and winter is near. The work of the leaves is over. The leaves turn yellow and brown. The leaves die and fall to the ground. Now the tree is bare. All winter it looks dead. But the tree is not dead. Under its coat of bark, the tree is alive."
8,My Five Senses,Aliki.,b010_MyFiveSenses.txt,1,"I can see! I see with my eyes. I can hear! I hear with my ears. I can smell! I smell with my nose. I can taste! I taste with my tongue. I can touch! I touch with my fingers. I do all this with my senses. I have five senses. When I see the sun or a frog or my baby sister, I use my sense of sight. I am seeing. When I hear a drum or a fire engine or a bird, I use my sense of hearing. I am hearing. When I smell soap or a pine tree or cookies just out of the oven, I use my sense of smell. I am smelling. When I drink my milk and eat my food, I use my sense of taste. I am tasting. When I touch a kitten or a balloon or water, I use my sense of touch. I am touching. Sometimes I use all my senses at once. Sometimes I use only one. I often play a game with myself. I guess how many senses I am using at that time. When I look at the moon and the stars, I use one sense. I am seeing. When I laugh and play with my puppy, I use four senses. I see, hear, smell, and touch. When I bounce a ball, I use three senses. I see, hear, touch. Sometimes I use more of one sense and less of another. But each sense is very important to me, because it makes me aware. To be aware is to see all there is to see… hear all there is to hear… smell all there is to smell… taste all there is to taste… touch all there is to touch. Wherever I go, whatever I do, every minute of the day, my senses are working. They make me aware."
9,Starfish,"Hurd, Edith Thacher",b011_Starfish.txt,1,"Starfish live in the sea. Starfish live deep down in the sea. Starfish live in pools by the sea. Some starfish are purple. Some starfish are pink. This is the sunflower starfish. It is the biggest of all. Starfish have many arms. The arms are called rays. Starfish have arms, but no legs. Starfish have feet, but no toes. They glide and slide on tiny tube feet. They move as slowly as a snail. The basket star looks like a starfish, but it is a little different. It doesn’t have tube feet. It moves with its rays. It has rays that go up and rays that go down. Tiny brittle stars are like the basket star. They hide under rocks in pools by the sea. The mud star hides in the mud. It is a starfish. It has tiny tube feet. A starfish has no eyes. A starfish has no ears or nose. Its tiny mouth is on its underside. When a starfish is hungry, it slides and it glides on its tiny tube feet. It hunts for mussels and oysters and clams. It feels for the mussels, It feels for the oysters. It feels for the clams. It feels for something to eat. The starfish crawls over a clam. Its rays go over it. Its rays go under it. Its rays go all over the clam. The starfish pulls and pulls. It pulls the shells open. It eats the clam inside. Sometimes a starfish loses a ray. A crab may pull it off. A rock may fall on it. But this does not hurt. It does not bother the starfish. The starfish just grows another ray. In the spring when the sun shines warm, and the sea grows warm, starfish lay eggs. Starfish lay eggs in the water. They lay many, many, many tiny eggs. The eggs look like sand in the sea. The tiny eggs float in the water. They float up and down. They move with the waves and the tide, up and down, up and down."
10,A Weed is a Flower: The Life of George Washington Carver,Aliki.,b012_AWeedisaFlower.txt,1,"George Washington Carver was born in Missouri in 1860-more than a hundred years ago. It was a terrible time. Mean men rode silently in the night, kidnapping slaves form their owners and harming those who tried to stop them. One night, a band of these men rode up to the farm of Moses Carver, who owned George and his mother, Mary. Everyone ran in fear. But before Mary could hide her baby, the men cam and snatched them both, and rode away into the night. Moses Carver sent a man to look for them. Mary was never found. But in a few days, the man returned with a small bundle wrapped in his coat and tied to the back of his saffle. It was the baby, George. George was not discouraged. He moved to Iowa and found a college which was glad to have a black student. At college, George continued to work. He opened a laundry where he washed his schoolmates' clothes. And, he continued to learn. His teachers and friends soon realized that this earnest young man was bursting with talents. He played the piano, he sang beautifully, and he was an outstanding painter. In fact, for a time he thought of becoming an artist.

13,My Father’s Dragon,"Gannett, Ruth Stiles. ",b018_MyFathersDragon.txt,2,"“Who are you?” the lion yelled at my father. “My name is Elmer Elevator.” “Where do you think you are going?” “I’m going home,” said my father. “That’s what you think!” said the lion. “Ordinarily I’d save you for afternoon tea, but I happen to be upset enough and hungry enough to eat you right now.” And he picked up my father in his front paws to feel how fat he was. My father said, “Oh, please, Lion, before you eat me, tell me why you are so particularly upset today.” “It’s my mane,” said the lion, as he was figuring out how many bites a little boy would make. “You see what a dreadful mess it is, and I don’t seem to be able to do anything about it. My mother is coming over on the dragon this afternoon, and if she sees me this way I’m afraid she’ll stop my allowance. She can’t stand messy manes! But I’m going to eat you now, so it won’t make any difference to you.” “Oh, wait a minute,” said my father, “and I’ll give you just the things you need to make your mane a tidy and beautiful. I have them here in my pack.” “You do?” said the lion, “Well, give them to me, and perhaps I’ll save you for afternoon tea after all,” and he put my father down on the ground.” My father opened the pack and took out the comb and the brush and the seven hair ribbons of different colors. “Look,” he said, “I’ll show you what to do on your forelock, where you can watch me. First you brush a while, and then you comb, and then you brush again until all the twigs and snarls are gone. Then you divide it up into three and braid it like this and tie a ribbon around the end.” Ad my father was doing this, the lion watched very carefully and began to look much happier. When my father tied the ribbon he was all smiles. “Oh, that’s wonderful, really wonderful!” said the lion. “Let me have the comb and brush and see if I can do it.” So my father gave him the comb and brush and the lion began busily grooming his mane. As a matter of fact, he was so busy that he didn’t even know when my father left."
14,The Fire Cat,"Averill, Esther. ",b019_TheFireCat.txt,2,"Joe took Pickles to the Chief, who was sitting at his desk. “Oh!” said the Chief. “I know this young cat. He is the one who chases little cats.” “How do you know?” asked Joe. The Chief answered, “A Fire Chief knows many things.” Just then the telephone began to ring. “Hello,” said the Chief. “Oh, hello, Mrs. Goodkind. Yes, Pickles is here. He came with Joe. What did you say? You think Pickles would like to live in our firehouse? Well, we shall see. Thank you, Mrs. Goodkind. Good-bye.” The Chief looked at Pickles and said, “Mrs. Goodkind says you are not a bad cat. And Joe likes you. I will let you live here IF you will learn to be a good firehouse cat.” Pickles walked quietly up the stairs after Joe. Joe and Pickles went into a room where the firemen lived. The men were pleased to have a cat. They wanted to play with Pickles. But suddenly the fire bell rang. All the firemen ran to a big pole and down they went. The pole was the fast way to get to their trucks. Pickles could hear the trucks start up and rush off to the fire. Pickles said to himself, “I must learn to do what the firemen do, I must learn to slide down the pole.” He jumped and put his paws around the pole. Down he fell with a BUMP. “Bumps or no bumps, I must try again,” said Pickles. Up the stairs he ran. Down the pole he came – and bumped. But by the time the firemen came back from the fire, Pickles could slide down the pole. “What a wonderful cat you are!” said the firemen. The Chief did not say anything. Pickles said to himself, “I must keep learning everything I can.” So he learned to jump up on one of the big trucks. And he learned to sit up straight on the seat while the truck raced to a fire. “What a wonderful cat you are!” said the firemen. The Chief did not say anything. Pickles said to himself, “Now I must learn to help the firemen with their work.” At the next fire, he jumped down from the truck. He ran to a big hose, put his paws around it, and tried to help a fireman shoot water at the flames. “What a wonderful cat you are!” said the firemen. The Chief did not say anything. The next day the Chief called all the firemen to his desk. Then he called for Pickles. Pickles did not know what was going to happen. He said to himself, “Maybe the Chief does not like the way I work. Maybe he wants to send me back to my old yard.” But Pickles went to the Chief. At the Chief’s desk stood all the firemen – and Mrs. Goodkind! The Chief said to Pickles, “I have asked Mrs. Goodkind to come because she was your first friend. Pickles, jump up on my desk. I have something to say to you.” Pickles jumped up on the desk and looked at the Chief. Out of the desk the Chief took – a little fire hat! “Pickles,” said the Chief, “I have watched you at your work. You have worked hard. The time has come for you to know that you are now our Fire Cat.” And with these words, the Chief put the little hat on Pickles’ head."
15,Amos & Boris,"Steig, William",b020_AmosBoris.txt,2,"Amos, a mouse, lived by the ocean. He loved the ocean. He loved the smell of sea air. He loved to hear the surf sounds—the bursting breakers, the backwashes with rolling pebbles. He thought a lot about the ocean, and he wondered about the faraway places on the other side of the water. One day he started building a boat on the beach. He worked on it in the daytime, while at night he studied navigation.  When the boat was finished, he loaded it with cheese, biscuits, acorns, honey, wheat germ, two barrels of fresh water, a compass, a sextant, a telescope, a saw, a hammer and nails and some wood in case repairs should be necessary, a needle and thread for hemming of torn sails, and various other necessities such as bandages and iodine, a yo-yo and playing cards. On the sixth of September, with a very calm sea, he waited till the high tide had almost reached his boat; then, using his most savage strength, he just managed to push the boat into the water, climb on board, and set sail. The Rodent, for that was the boat’s name, proved to be very well made and very well suited to the sea. And Arnos, after one miserable day of seasickness proved to be natural sailor, very well suited to the ship. He was enjoying his trip immensely. It was beautiful weather. Day and night he moved up and down, up and down, on waves as big as mountains and he was full of wonder, full of enterprise, and full of love for life. One night, in a phosphorescent sea, he marveled at the sight of some whales spouting luminous water; and later, lying on the deck of his boat gazing at the immense, starry sky, the tiny mouse Amos, a little speck of a living thing in the vast living universe, felt thoroughly akin to it all. Overwhelmed by the beauty and mystery of everything he rolled over and over and right off the deck of his boat and into the sea. “Help!” he squeaked as he grabbed desperately at the Rodent. But it evaded his grasp and went bowling along under full sail, and he never saw it again. And there he was! Where? In the middle of the immense ocean, a thousand miles from the nearest shore, with no one else in sight as far as the eye could see and not even so much as a stick of driftwood to hold on to. “Should I try to swim home?” Amos wondered. “Or should I just try to stay afloat?” He might swim a mile, but never a thousand, He decided to just keep afloat, treading water and hoping that something-who knows what?-would turn up and save him. But what if a shark, or some big fish, a horse mackerel, turned up? What was he supposed to do to protect himself? He didn’t know. Morning came, as it always does. He was getting terribly tired. He was a very sad, very cold, very wet and worried mouse. There was still nothing in sight but the empty sea. Then, as if things weren’t bad enough, it began to rain. At last the rain stopped and the noonday sun game him a bit of cheer and warmth in the vast loneliness; but his strength was giving out. He began to wonder what it would be like to drown. Would it take very long? Would it feel just awful? Would his soul go to heaven? Would there be other mice there? As he was asking himself these dreadful questions a huge head burst though the surface of the water and loomed up over him. It was a whale. “What sort of fish are you?” the whale asked. “You must be one of a kind!” “I’m not a fish, “said Amos. “I’m a mouse, which is a mammal, the highest form of life. I live on land.” “Holy clam and cuttlefish!” said the whale. “I’m a mammal myself, though I live in the sea. Call me Boris,” he added. Amos introduced himself and told Boris how he came to be there in the middle of the ocean. The whale said he would be happy to take Amos to the Ivory Coast of Africa, where he happened to be headed anyway, to attend a meeting of whales from all the seven seas. But Amos said he’d had enough adventure to last him a while. He waned only to get back home and hoped the whale wouldn’t mind going out of his way to take him there. “Not only would l not mind, “said Boris, “I would consider it a privilege. What other whale in all the world ever had the chance to get to know such a strange creature as you! Please climb aboard.” And Amos got on Boris’s back. “Are you sure you’re a mammal? Amos asked. “You smell more like a fish. “ Then Boris the whale went swimming along, with Amos the mouse on his back. What a relief to be so safe, so secure again! Amos lay down in the sun, and being worn to a frazzle, he was soon asleep. Then all of a sudden he was in the air again, wide awake, spluttering and splashing about! Boris had forgotten for a moment that he had a passenger on his back and had sounded when he realized his mistake, he surface so quickly that Amos was sent somersaulting, tail over whiskers, high into the air. Hitting the waster hurt. Crazy with rage, Amos screamed and punched a Boris until he remembered he owed his life to the whale and quietly climbed on his back. From then on, whenever Boris wanted to sound, he warned Amos in advance and got his okay, and whenever he sounded Amos took a swim. Swimming along, sometimes at great speed, sometimes slowly and leisurely, sometimes resting and exchanging ideas, sometimes stopping to sleep, it took then a week to reach Amos’s home shore. During that time, they developed a deep admiration for one another. Boris admired the delicacy, the quivering daintiness, the light touch, the small voice, the gemlike radiance of the mouse. Amos admired the bulk, the grandeur, the power, the purpose, the rich voice, and the abounding friendliness of the whale. They became the closest possible friends. They told each other about their lives, their ambitions. They shared their deepest secrets with each other. The whale was very curious about life on land and was sorry that he could never experience it. Amos was fascinated by the whale’s accounts of what went on deep under the sea. Amos sometimes enjoyed running up and down on the whales back for exercise. When he was hungry, he ate plankton. The only thing he missed was fresh, unsalted water. The time came to say goodbye. They were at the shore. “I wish we could be friends forever,” said Boris. “We will be friends forever but we can’t bet together. You moist live on land and I must live at sea. I’ll never forget you, though. “and you can be sure I’ll never forget you,” said Amos...\ “ I will always be grateful to you for saving my life and I want you to remember that if you ever need my help I’d be more than glad to give it~!” How he could ever possibly help Boris, Amos didn’t know, but he knew how willing he was. The whale couldn’t take Amos all the way in to land. They said their last goodbye and Amos dived off Boris’s back and swam to the sand. From the top of a cliff he watched Boris spout twice and disappear. Boris laughed to himself. “How could that little mouse every help me? Little as he is, he’s all heart. I love him, and I’ll miss him terribly.” Boris went to the conference off the Ivory Coast of Africa and then went back to a life of whaling about, while Amos returned to his life of mousing around. And they were both happy. Many years after the incidents just described, when Amos was no longer a very young mouse; and when Boris was no longer a very young whale, there occurred one of the worst storms of the century, Hurricane Yetta; and it just so happened that Boris the whale was flung ashore by a tidal wave and stranded on the very shore where Amos happened to make his home. It also just so happened that when the storm had cleared up and Boris was lying high and dry on the sand, losing his moisture in the hot sun and needing desperately to be back in the water, Amos came down to the beach to see how much damage Hurricane Yetta had done. Of course Boris and Amos recognized each other at once. I don’t have to tell you how these old friends felt meeting again in this desperate situation. Amos rushed toward Boris. Boris could only look at Amos. “Amos, help me,” said the mounting of a whale to the mote of a mouse. “I think I’ll die if I don’t get back in the water soon.” Amos gazed at Boris in an agony of pity. He realized he had to do something very fast and had to think very fast about what it was he had to do. Suddenly he was gone. “I’m afraid he won’t be able to help me, “said Brisk to himself. “Much as he wants to do something, what can such a little fellow do?” Just as Amos had once felt, all alone in the middle of the ocean Boris felt now, lying alone on the shore. He was sure he would die. And just as he was preparing to die, Amos came racing back with two of the biggest elephants he could find. Without wasting time, these two goodhearted elephants got to pushing with all their might at Boris’ huge body until he began turning over, breaded with sand, and rolling down towed the sea. Amos, standing on the head of one of the elephants, yelled instructions, but no one heard him. In a few minutes, Boris was already in water, with waves washing at him, and he was feeling the wonderful wetness. “You have to be out of the sea rally to know how good it is to be in it,” he thought. “That is, if you’re a whale.” Soon he as able to wiggle and wiggle into deeper water.’ He looked back at Amos on the elephant’s head. Tears were rolling down the great whale's cheeks. The tiny mouse had tears in these eyes too. “Goodbye, dear friend,” squeaked Amos. “Goodbye, dear friend,” rumbled Boris, and he disappeared in the wave. They knew they might never meet again. They know they would never forget each other. "
16,The Treasure,"Shulevitz, Uri",b021_TheTreasure.txt,2,"There once was a man and his name was Isaac. He lived in such poverty that again and again he went to bed hungry. One night, he had a dream. In his dream, a voice told him to go to the capital city and look for a treasure under the bridge by the Royal Palace. ""It is only a dream,"" he thought when he woke up, and he paid no attention to it. Isaac told him the dream. The captain laughed. ""You poor fellow,"" he said, ""what a pity you wore your shoes out for a dream."" Listen if I believed a dream I once had, I would go right now to the city you came from, and I'd look for a treasure under the stove in the house of a fello named Isaac."" And he laughed again."
17,The Stories Julian Tells,"Cameron, Ann",b022_TheStoriesJulianTells.txt,2,"""I'm going to make something special for your mother,"" my father said. My mother was out shopping. My father was in the kitchen, looking at the pots and the pans and the jars of this and that. ""What are you going to make?"" I said. ""A pudding,"" he said. My father is a big man with wild black hair. When he laughs, the sun laughs in the window-panes. When he thinks, you can almost see his thoughts sitting on all the tables and chairs. When he is angry, me and my little brother, Huey, shiver to the bottom of our shoes. ""What kind of pudding will you make?"" Huey said. ""A wonderful pudding,"" my father said. ""It will taste like a whole raft of lemons. It will taste like a night on the sea."" Then he took down a knife and sliced five lemons in half. He squeezed the first one. Juice squirted in my eye. ""Stand back!"" he said, and squeezed again. The seeds flew out on the floor. ""Pick up those seeds, Huey!"" he said. Huey took the broom and swept them up. My father cracked some eggs and put the yolks in a pan and the whites in a bowl. He rolled up his sleeves and pushed back his hair and beat up the yolks. ""Sugar, Julian!"" he said, and I poured in the sugar. He went on beating. Then he put in lemon juice and cream and set the pan on the stove. The pudding bubbled and he stirred it fast. Cream splashed on the stove. ""Wipe that up, Huey!"" he said. Huey did. ""If I just put my finger in—there—I'll know how it tastes,"" Huey said. And he did it. ""You did it!"" I said. ""How does it taste?"" ""It tastes like a whole raft of lemons,"" he said. ""It castes like a night on the sea."" ""You've made a hole in the pudding!"" I said. ""But since you did k, I'll have a taste."" And it tasted like a whole night of lemons. It tasted like floating at sea. ""It's such a big pudding,"" Huey said. ""It can't hurt to have a little more."" ""Since you took more, I'll have more,"" I said. 'That was a bigger lick than I took!"" Huey said. ""I'm going to have more again."" ""Whoops!"" I said. ""You put in your whole hand!"" Huey said. ""Look at the pudding you spilled on the floor!"" ""I am going to clean it up,"" I said. And I took the rag from the sink. ""That's not really clean,"" Huey said. ""It's the best I can do,"" I said. ""Look at the pudding!"" Huey said. It looked like craters on the moon. ""We have to smooth this over,"" I said. ""So it looks the way it did before! Let's get spoons."" And we evened the top of the pudding with spoons, and while we evened it, we ate some more. ""There isn't much left,"" I said. ""We were supposed to leave the pudding alone,"" Huey said. ""We'd better get away from here,"" I said. We ran into our bedroom and crawled under the bed. After a long time we heard my father's voice. ""Come into the kitchen, dear,"" he said. ""I have something for you."" ""Why, what is it?"" my mother said, out in the kitchen. Under the bed, Huey and I pressed ourselves to the wall. ""Look,"" said my Ether, out in the kitchen. ""A wonderful pudding."" ""Where is the pudding?"" my mother said. ""WHERE ARE YOU BOYS?"" my father said. His voice went through every crack and corner of the house. We felt like two leaves in a storm. ""WHERE ARE YOU? I SAID!"" My father's voice was booming. Huey whispered to me, ""I'm scared."" We heard my father walking slowly through the rooms. ""Huey!"" he called. ""Julian!"" We could see his feet. He was coming into OM room. He liked the bedspread. There was his face, and his eyes like black lightning. He grabbed us by the legs and pulled. ""STAND UP!"" he said. We stood.

18,"Sarah, Plain and Tall","MacLachlan, Patricia",b023_SarahPlainandTall.txt,2,"“Did Mama sing every day?” asked Caleb. ""Every-singleday?'' He sat close to the fire, his chin in his hand. It was dusk, and the dogs lay beside him on the warm hearthstones. ""Every-single-day,"" I told him for the second time this week. For the twentieth time this month. The hundredth time this year! And the past few years? ""And did Papa sing, too!"" ""Yes. Papa sang, too. Don't get so close, Caleb. You'll heat up."" He pushed his chair back. It made a hollow scraping sound on the hearthstones, and the dogs stirred. Lottie, small and black, wagged her tail and lifted her head. Nick slept on. I turned the bread dough over and over on the marble slab on the kitchen table. ""Well, Papa doesn't sing anymore,"" said Caleb very softly. A log broke apart and crackled in the fireplace. He looked up at me. “What did I look like when I was born?"" ""You didn't have any clothes on,"" I told him. ""I know that,"" he said. ""You looked like this."" I held the bread dough up in a round pale ball. ""I had hair,"" said Caleb seriously. ""Not enough to talk about,"" I said. ""And she named me Caleb,"" he went on, filling in the old familiar story. ""I would have named you Troublesome,"" I said, making Caleb smile. ""And Mama handed me to you in the yellow blanket and said ..."" He waited for me to finish the story. ""And said ... ?"" I sighed. ""And Mama said, 'Isn't he beautiful, Anna'' "" ""And I was,"" Caleb finished. Caleb thought the story was over, and I didn't tell him what I had really thought. He was homely and plain, and he had a terrible holler and a horrid smell. But these were not the worst of him. Mama died the next morning. That was the worst thing about Caleb. ""Isn't he beautiful, Anna!"" Her last words to me. I had gone to bed thinking how wretched he looked. And I forgot to say good night. I wiped my hands on my apron and went to the window. Outside, the prairie reached out and touched the places where the sky came down. Though winter was nearly over, there were patches of snow and ice everywhere. I looked at the long dirt road that crawled across the plains, remembering the morning that Mama had died, cruel and sunny. They had come for her in a wagon and taken her away to be buried. And then the cousins and aunts and uncles had come and tried to fill up the house. But they couldn't. Slowly, one by one, they left. And then the days seemed long and dark like winter days, even though it wasn't winter. And Papa didn't sing. Isn't he beautiful, Anna? No, Mama. It was hard to think of Caleb as beautiful. It took three whole days for me to love him, sitting in the chair by the fire, Papa washing up the supper dishes, Caleb's tiny hand brushing my cheek. And a smile. It was the smile, I know. ""Can you remember her songs!"" asked Caleb. ""Mama's songs?"" I turned from the window. ""No. Only that she sang about flowers and birds. Sometimes about the moon at nighttime."" Caleb reached down and touched Lottie's head. ""Maybe,"" he said, his voice low, ""if you remember the songs, then I might remember her, too."" My eyes widened and tears came. Then the door opened and wind blew in with Papa, and I went to stir the stew. Papa put his arms around me and put his nose in my hair. ""Nice soapy smell, that stew,"" he said. I laughed. ""That's my hair "" Caleb came over and threw his arms around Papa's neck and hung down as Papa swung him back and forth, and the dogs sat up. ""Cold in town,"" said Papa. ""And Jack was feisty."" Jack was Papa's horse that he'd raised from a colt. ""Rascal,"" murmured Papa, smiling, because no matter what Jack did Papa loved him. I spooned up the stew and lighted the oil lamp and we ate with the dogs crowding under the table, hoping for spills or handouts. Papa might not have told us about Sarah that night if Caleb hadn't asked him the question. After the dishes were cleared and washed and Papa was filling the tin pail with ashes, Caleb spoke up. It wasn't a question, really. ""You don't sing anymore,"" he said. He said it harshly. Not because he meant to, but because he had been thinking of it for so long. ""Why?"" he asked more gently. Slowly Papa straightened up. There was a long silence, and the dogs looked up, wondering at it. ""I've forgotten the old songs,"" said Papa quietly. He sat down. ""But maybe there's a way to remember them."" He looked up at us. ""How!"" asked Caleb eagerly. Papa leaned back in the chair. ""I've placed an advertisement in the newspapers. For help."" ""You mean a housekeeper?"" I asked, surprised. Caleb and I looked at each other and burst out laughing, remembering Hilly, our old housekeeper. She was round and slow and shuffling. She snored in a high whistle at night, like a tea-kettle, and let the fire go out. ""No,"" said Papa slowly. ""Not a housekeeper."" He paused. ""A wife."" Caleb stared at Papa. ""A wife? You mean a Mother? "" Nick slid his face onto Papa's lap and Papa stroked his ears. ""That, too,"" said Papa. ""Like Maggie."" Matthew, our neighbor to the south, had written to ask for a wife and mother for his children. And Maggie had come from Tennessee. Her hair was the color of turnips and she laughed. Papa reached into his pocket and unfolded a letter written on white paper. ""And I have received an answer."" Papa read to us: ""Dear Mr. Jacob Witting, ""I am Sarah Wheaten from Maine as you will see from my letter. I am answering your advertisement. I have never been married, though I have been asked. I have lived with an older brother, William, who is about to be married. His wife-to-be is young and energetic. ""I have always loved to live by the sea, but at this time I feel a move is necessary. And the truth is, the sea is as far east as I can go. My choice, as you can see, is limited. This should not be taken as an insult. I am strong and I work hard and I am willing to travel. But I am not mild mannered. If you should still care to write, I would be interested in your children and about where you live. And you. Very truly yours, Sarah Elisabeth Wheaten ""P.S. Do you have opinions on cats? I have one.” No one spoke when Papa finished the letter. He kept looking at it in his hands, reading it over to himself. Finally I turned my head a bit to sneak a look at Caleb. He was smiling. I smiled, too. ""One thing,"" I said in the quiet of the room. ""What's that?"" asked Papa, looking up. I put my arm around Caleb. ""Ask her if she sings,"" I said. 2 Caleb and Papa and I wrote letters to Sarah, and before the ice and snow had melted from the fields, we all received answers. Mine came first. Dear Anna, Yes, I can braid hair and I can make stew and bake bread, though I prefer to build bookshelves and print. My favorite colors are the colors of the sea, blue and gray and green, depending on the weather. My brother William is a fisherman, and he tells me that when he is in the middle of a fogbound sea the water is a color for which there is no name. He catches flounder and sea bass and bluefish. Sometimes he sees whales. And birds, too, of course. I am enclosing a book of sea birds so you will see what William and I see every day. Very truly yours, Sarah Elisabeth Wheaten Caleb read and read the letter so many times that the ink began to run and the folds tore. He read the book about sea birds over and over. ""Do you think she'll come?"" asked Caleb. ""And will she stay? What if she thinks we are loud and pesky?"" ""You are loud and pesky,"" I told him. But I was worried, too. Sarah loved the sea, I could tell. Maybe she wouldn't leave there after all to come where there were fields and grass and sky and not much else. ""What if she comes and doesn't like our house!"" Caleb asked. ""I told her it was small. Maybe I shouldn't have told her it was small."" ""Hush, Caleb. Hush."" Caleb's letter came soon after, with a picture of a cat drawn on the envelope. Dear Caleb, My cat's name is Seal because she is gray like the seals that swim offshore in Maine. She is glad that Lottie and Nick send their greetings. She likes dogs most of the time. She says their footprints are much larger than hers (which she is enclosing in return). Your house sounds lovely, even though it is far out in the country with no close neighbors. My house is tall and the shingles are gray because of the salt from the sea. There are roses nearby. Yes, I do like small rooms sometimes. Yes, I can keep a fire going at night. I do not know if I snore. Seal has never told me. Very truly yours, Sarah Elisabeth ""Did you really ask her about fires and snoring?"" I asked, amazed. ""I wished to know,"" Caleb said. He kept the letter with him, reading it in the barn and in the fields and by the cow pond. And always in bed at night. One morning, early, Papa and Caleb and I were cleaning out the horse stalls and putting down new bedding. Papa stopped suddenly and leaned on his pitchfork. ""Sarah has said she will come for a month's time if we wish her to,"" he said, his voice loud in the dark barn. ""To see how it is. Just to see."" Caleb stood by the stall door and folded his arms across his chest. ""I think,"" he began. Then, ""I think,"" he said slowly, ""that it would be good--to say yes,"" he finished in a rush. Papa looked at me. ""I say yes,"" I told him, grinning. ""Yes,"" said Papa. ""Then yes it is."" And the three of us, all smiling, went to work again. The next day Papa went to town to mail his letter to Sarah. It was rainy for days, and the clouds followed. The house was cool and damp and quiet. Once I set four places at the table, then caught myself and put the extra plate away. Three lambs were born, one with a black face. And then Papa's letter came. It was very short. Dear Jacob, I will come by train. I will wear a yellow bonnet. I am plain and tall. Sarah ""What's that?"" asked Caleb excitedly, peering over Papa's shoulder. He pointed. ""There, written at the bottom of the letter."" Papa read it to himself. Then he smiled, holding up the letter for us to see. Tell them I sing was all it said. 3 Sarah came in the spring. She came through green grass fields that bloomed with Indian paint-brush, red and orange, and blue-eyed grass. Papa got up early for the long day's trip to the train and back. He brushed his hair so slick and shiny that Caleb laughed. He wore a clean blue shirt, and a belt instead of suspenders. He fed and watered the horses, talking to them as he hitched them up to the wagon. Old Bess, calm and kind; Jack, wild-eyed, reaching over to nip Bess on the neck. ""Clear day, Bess,"" said Papa, rubbing her nose. ""Settle down, Jack."" He leaned his head on Jack. And then Papa drove off along the dirt road to fetch Sarah. Papa's new wife. Maybe. Maybe our new mother. Gophers ran back and forth across the road, stopping to stand up and watch the wagon. Far off in the field a woodchuck ate and listened. Ate and listened. Caleb and I did our chores without talking. We shoveled out the stalls and laid down new hay. We fed the sheep. We swept and straightened and carried wood and water. And then our chores were done. Caleb pulled on my shirt. ""Is my face clean!"" he asked. ""Can my face be too clean?"" He looked alarmed. ""No, your face is clean but not too clean,"" I said. Caleb slipped his hand into mine as we stood on the porch, watching the road. He was afraid. ""Will she be nice?"" he asked. ""Like Maggie?"" ""Sarah will be nice,"" I told him. ""How far away is Maine?"" he asked. ""You know how far. Far away, by the sea."" ""Will Sarah bring some sea?"" he asked. “No, you cannot bring the sea."" The sheep ran in the field, and far off the cows moved slowly to the pond, like turtles. ""Will she like us?"" asked Caleb very softly. I watched a marsh hawk wheel down behind the barn. He looked up at me. ""Of course she will like us."" He answered his own question. ""We are nice,"" he added, making me smile. We waited and watched. I rocked on the porch and Caleb rolled a marble on the wood floor. Back and forth. Back and forth. The marble was blue. We saw the dust from the wagon first, rising above the road, above the heads of Jack and Old Bess. Caleb climbed up onto the porch roof and shaded his eyes. ""A bonnet! "" he cried. ""I see a yellow bonnet! "" The dogs came out from under the porch, ears up, their eyes on the cloud of dust bringing Sarah. The wagon passed the fenced field, and the cows and sheep looked up, too. It rounded the windmill and the barn and the windbreak of Russian olive that Mama had planted long ago. Nick began to bark, then Lottie, and the wagon clattered into the yard and stopped by the steps. ""Hush,"" said Papa to the dogs. And it was quiet. Sarah stepped down from the wagon, a cloth bag in her hand. She reached up and took off her yellow bonnet, smoothing back her brown hair into a bun. She was plain and tall. ""Did you bring some sea?"" cried Caleb beside me. ""Something from the sea,"" said Sarah, smiling. ""And me."" She turned and lifted a black case from the wagon. ""And Seal, too."" Carefully she opened the case, and Seal, gray with white feet, stepped out. Lottie lay down, her head on her paws, staring. Nick leaned down to sniff. Then he lay down, too. ""The cat will be good in the barn,"" said Papa. ""For mice."" Sarah smiled. ""She will be good in the house, too.” Sarah took Caleb's hand, then mine. Her hands were large and rough. She gave Caleb a shell--a moon snail, she called it--that was curled and smelled of salt. ""The gulls fly high and drop the shells on the rocks below,"" she told Caleb. ""When the shell is broken, they eat what is inside."" ""That is very smart,"" said Caleb. ""For you, Anna,"" said Sarah, ""a sea stone."" And she gave me the smoothest and whitest stone I had ever seen. ""The sea washes over and over and around the stone, rolling it until it is round and perfect."" ""That is very smart, too,"" said Caleb. He looked up at Sarah. ""We do not have the sea here."" Sarah turned and looked out over the plains. ""No,"" she said. ""There is no sea here. But the land rolls a little like the sea."" My father did not see her look, but I did. And I knew that Caleb had seen it, too. Sarah was not smiling. Sarah was already lonely. In a month's time the preacher might come to marry Sarah and Papa. And a month was a long time. Time enough for her to change her mind and leave us. Papa took Sarah's bags inside, where her room was ready with a quilt on the bed and blue flax dried in a vase on the night table. Seal stretched and made a small cat sound. I watched her circle the dogs and sniff the air. Caleb came out and stood beside me. ""When will we sing'"" he whispered. I shook my head, turning the white stone over and over in my hand. I wished everything was as perfect as the stone. I wished that Papa and Caleb and I were perfect for Sarah. I wished we had a sea of our own. 4 The dogs loved Sarah first. Lottie slept beside her bed, curled in a soft circle, and Nick leaned his face on the covers in the morning, watching for the first sign that Sarah was awake. No one knew where Seal slept. Seal was a roamer. Sarah's collection of shells sat on the windowsill. ""A scallop,"" she told us, picking up the shells one by one, ""a sea clam, an oyster, a razor clam. And a conch shell. If you put it to your ear you can heat the sea."" She put it to Caleb's ear, then mine. Papa listened, too. Then Sarah listened once more, with a look so sad and far away that Caleb leaned against me. ""At least Sarah can hear the sea,"" he whispered. Papa was quiet and shy with Sarah, and so was I. But Caleb talked to Sarah from morning until the light left the sky. ""Where are you going?"" he asked. ""To do what? "" ""To pick flowers,"" said Sarah. ""I'll hang some of them upside down and dry them so they'll keep some color. And we can have flowers all winter long."" ""I'll come, too!"" cried Caleb. ""Sarah said winter,"" he said to me. ""That means Sarah will stay."" Together we picked flowers, paintbrush and clover and prairie violets. There were buds on the wild roses that climbed up the paddock fence. ""The roses will bloom in early summer,"" I told Sarah. I looked to see if she knew what I was thinking. Summer was when the wedding would be. Might be. Sarah and Papa's wedding. We hung the flowers from the ceiling in little bunches. ""I've never seen this before,"" said Sarah. ""What is it called?"" ""Bride's bonnet,"" I told her. Caleb smiled at the name. ""We don't have this by the sea,"" she said. ""We have seaside goldenrod and wild asters and woolly ragwort."" ""Woolly ragwort! "" Caleb whooped. He made up a song. ""Woolly ragwort all around, Woolly ragwort on the ground. Woolly ragwort grows and grows, Woolly ragwort in your nose."" Sarah and Papa laughed, and the dogs lifted their heads and thumped their tails against the wood floor. Seal sat on a kitchen chair and watched us with yellow eyes. We ate Sarah's stew, the late light coming through the windows. Papa had baked bread that was still warm from the fire. ""The stew is fine,"" said Papa. ""Ayuh."" Sarah nodded. ""The bread, too."" ""What does 'ayuh' mean?"" asked Caleb. ""In Maine it means yes,"" said Sarah. ""Do you want more stew!"" ""Ayuh,"" said Caleb. ""Ayuh,"" echoed my father. After dinner Sarah told us about William. ""He has a grayand-white boat named Kittiwake."" She looked out the window. ""That is a small gull found way off the shore where William fishes. There are three aunts who live near us. They wear silk dresses and no shoes. You would love them."" ""Ayuh,"" said Caleb. ""Does your brother look like you?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" said Sarah. ""He is plain and tall."" At dusk Sarah cut Caleb's hair on the front steps, gathering his curls and scattering them on the fence and ground. Seal batted some hair around the porch as the dogs watched. ""Why?"" asked Caleb. ""For the birds,"" said Sarah. ""They will use it for their nests. Later we can look for nests of curls."" ""Sarah said 'later,' "" Caleb whispered to me as we spread his hair about. ""Sarah will stay."" Sarah cut Papa's hair, too. No one else saw, but I found him behind the barn, tossing the pieces of hair into the wind for the birds. Sarah brushed my hair and tied it up in back with a rose velvet ribbon she had brought from Maine. She brushed hers long and free and tied it back, too, and we stood side by side looking into the mirror. I looked taller, like Sarah, and fair and thin. And with my hair pulled back I looked a little like her daughter. Sarah's daughter. And then it was time for singing. Sarah sang us a song we had never heard before as we sat on the porch, insects buzzing in the dark, the rustle of cows in the grasses. It was called ""Sumer Is Icumen in,"" and she taught it to us all, even Papa, who sang as if he had never stopped singing. “Sumer is icumen in Lhude sing cuccu!” ""What is sumer?"" asked Caleb. He said it ""soomer,"" the way Sarah had said it. ""Summer,"" said Papa and Sarah at the same time. Caleb and I looked at each other. Summer was coming. ""Tomorrow,"" said Sarah, ""I want to see the sheep. You know, I've never touched one."" ""Never?"" Caleb sat up. ""Never,"" said Sarah. She smiled and leaned back in her chair. ""But I've touched seals. Real seals. They are cool and slippery and they slide through the water like fish. They can cry and sing. And sometimes they bark, a little like dogs."" Sarah barked like a seal. And Lottie and Nick came running from the barn to jump up on Sarah and lick her face and make her laugh. Sarah stroked them and scratched their ears and it was quiet again. ""I wish I could touch a seal right now,"" said Caleb, his voice soft in the night. ""So do I,"" said Sarah. She sighed, then she began to sing the summer song again. Far off in a field, a meadowlark sang, too. 5 The sheep made Sarah smile. She sank her fingers into their thick, coarse wool. She talked to them, running with the lambs, letting them suck on her fingers. She named them after her favorite aunts, Harriet and Mattie and Lou. She lay down in the field beside them and sang ""Sumer Is Icumen in,"" her voice drifting over the meadow grasses, carried by the wind. She cried when we found a lamb that had died, and she shouted and shook her fist at the turkey buzzards that came from nowhere to eat it. She would not let Caleb or me come near. And that night, Papa went with a shovel to bury the sheep and a lantern to bring Sarah back. She sat on the porch alone. Nick crept up to lean against her knees. After dinner, Sarah drew pictures to send home to Maine. She began a charcoal drawing of the fields, rolling like the sea rolled. She drew a sheep whose ears were too big. And she drew a windmill. ""Windmill was my first word,"" said Caleb. ""Papa told me so."" ""Mine was flower,"" I said. ""What was yours, Sarah?"" ""Dune,"" said Sarah. ""Dune?"" Caleb looked up. ""In Maine,"" said Sarah, ""there are rock cliffs that rise up at the edge of the sea. And there are hills covered with pine and spruce trees, green with needles. But William and I found a sand dune all our own. It was soft and sparkling with bits of mica, and when we were little we would slide down the dune into the water."" Caleb looked out the window. ""We have no dunes here,"" he said. Papa stood up. ""Yes we do,"" he said. He took the lantern and went out the door to the barn. ""We do!"" Caleb called after him. He ran ahead, Sarah and I following, the dogs close behind. Next to the barn was Papa's mound of hay for bedding, nearly half as tall as the barn, covered with canvas to keep the rain from rotting it. Papa carried the wooden ladder from the barn and leaned it against the hay. ""There."" He smiled at Sarah. ""Our dune."" Sarah was very quiet. The dogs looked up at her, waiting. Sell brushed against her legs, her tail in the air. Caleb reached over and took her hand. ""It looks high up,"" he said. ""Are you scared, Sarah!"" ""Scared? Scared?"" exclaimed Sarah. ""You bet I'm not scared."" She climbed the ladder, and Nick began to bark. She climbed to the very top of the hay and sat, looking down at us. Above, the stars were coming out. Papa piled a bed of loose hay below with his pitchfork. The light of the lantern made his eyes shine when he smiled up at Sarah. ""Fine?"" called Papa. ""Fine,"" said Sarah. She lifted her arms over her head and slid down, down, into the soft hay. She lay, laughing, as the dogs rolled beside her. ""Was it a good dune?"" called Caleb. ""Yes,"" said Sarah. ""It is a fine dune."" Caleb and I climbed up and slid down. And Sarah did it three more times. At last Papa slid down, too, as the sky grew darker and the stars blinked like fireflies. We were covered with hay and dust, and we sneezed. In the kitchen, Caleb and I washed in the big wooden tub and Sarah drew more pictures to send to William. One was of Papa, his hair curly and full of hay. She drew Caleb, sliding down the hay, his arms like Sarah's over his head. And she drew a picture of me in the tub, my hair long and straight and wet. She looked at her drawing of the fields for a long time. ""Something is missing,"" she told Caleb. ""Something."" And she put it away. ""'Dear William,' "" Sarah read to us by lantern light that night. "" 'Sliding down our dune of hay is almost as fine as sliding down the sand dunes into the sea.' "" Caleb smiled at me across the table. He said nothing, but his mouth formed the words I had heard, too. Our dune. 6 The days grew longer. The cows moved close to the pond, where the water was cool and there were trees. Papa taught Sarah how to plow the fields, guiding the plow behind Jack and Old Bess, the reins around her neck. When the chores were done we sat in the meadow with the sheep, Sarah beside us, watching Papa finish. ""Tell me about winter,"" said Sarah. Old Bess nodded her head as she walked, but we could hear Papa speak sharply to Jack. ""Jack doesn't like work,"" said Caleb. ""He wants to be here in the sweet grass with us."" ""I don't blame him,"" said Sarah. She lay back in the grass with her arms under her head. ""Tell me about winter,"" she said again. ""Winter is cold here,"" said Caleb, and Sarah and I laughed. ""Winter is cold everywhere,"" I said. ""We go to school in winter,"" said Caleb. ""Sums and writing and books,"" he sang. ""I am good at sums and writing,"" said Sarah. ""I love books. How do you get to school?"" ""Papa drives us in the wagon. Or we walk the three miles when there is not too much snow."" Sarah sat up. ""Do you have lots of snow?"" ""Lots and lots and lots of snow,"" chanted Caleb, rolling around in the grass. ""Sometimes we have to dig our way out to feed the animals."" ""In Maine the barns are attached to the houses sometimes,"" said Sarah. Caleb grinned. ""So you could have a cow to Sunday supper?"" Sarah and I laughed. ""When there are bad storms, Papa ties a rope from the house to the barn so no one will get lost,"" said Caleb. I frowned. I loved winter. ""There is ice on the windows on winter mornings,"" I told Sarah. ""We can draw sparkling pictures and we can see our breath in the air. Papa builds a warm fire, and we bake hot biscuits and put on hundreds of sweaters. And if the snow is too high, we stay home from school and make snow people."" Sarah lay back in the all grasses again, her face nearly hidden. ""And is there wind?"" she asked. ""Do you like wind?"" asked Caleb. ""There is wind by the sea,"" said Sarah. ""There is wind here,"" said Caleb happily. ""It blows the snow and brings tumbleweeds and makes the sheep run. Wind and wind and wind! "" Caleb stood up and ran like the wind, and the sheep an after him. Sarah and I watched him jump over rock and gullies, the sheep behind him, stiff legged and fast. He circled the field, the sun making the top of his hair golden. He collapsed next to Sarah, and the lambs pushed their wet noses into us. ""Hello, Lou,"" said Sarah, smiling. ""Hello, Mattie."" The sun rose higher, and Papa stopped to take off his hat and wipe his face with his sleeve. ""I'm hot,"" said Sarah. ""I can't wait for winter wind. Let's swim."" ""Swim where?"" I asked her. ""I can't swim,"" said Caleb. ""Can't swim!"" exclaimed Sarah. ""I'll teach you in the cow pond."" ""That's for cows!"" I cried. But Sarah had grabbed our hands and we were running through the fields, ducking under the fence to the far pond. ""Shoe, cows,"" said Sarah as the cows looked up, startled. She took off her dress and waded into the water in her petticoat. She dived suddenly and disappeared for a moment as Caleb and I watched. She came up, laughing, her hair streaming free. Water beads sat on her shoulders. She tried to teach us how to float. I sank like a bucket filled with water and came up sputtering. But Caleb lay on his back and learned how to blow streams of water high in the air like a whale. The cows stood on the banks of the pond and stared and stopped their chewing. Water bugs circled us. ""Is this like the sea?"" asked Caleb. Sarah treaded water. ""The sea is salt,"" said Sarah. ""It stretches out as far as you can see. It gleams like the sun on glass. There are waves."" ""Like this?"" asked Caleb, and he pushed a wave at Sarah, making her cough and laugh. ""Yes,"" she said. ""Like that."" I held my breath and floated at last, looking up into the sky, afraid to speak. Crows flew over, three in a row. And I could hear a killdeer in the field. We climbed the bank and dried ourselves and lay in the grass again. The cows watched, their eyes sad in their dinner-plate faces. And I slept, dreaming a perfect dream. The fields had turned to a sea that gleamed like sun on glass. And Sarah was happy. 7 The dandelions in the fields had gone by, their heads soft as feathers. The summer roses were opening. Our neighbors, Matthew and Maggie, came to help Papa plow up a new field for corn. Sarah stood with us on the porch, watching their wagon wind up the road, two horses pulling it and one tied in back. I remembered the last time we had stood here alone, Caleb and I, waiting for Sarah. Sarah's hair was in thick braids that circled her head, wild daisies tucked here and there. Papa had picked them for her. Old Bess and Jack ran along the inside of the fence, whickering at the new horses. ""Papa needs five horses for the big gang plow,"" Caleb told Sarah. ""Prairie grass is hard."" Matthew and Maggie came with their two children and a sackful of chickens. Maggie emptied the sack into the yard and three red banty chickens clucked and scattered. ""They are for you,"" she told Sarah. ""For eating."" Sarah loved the chickens. She clucked back to them and fed them grain. They followed her, shuffling and scratching primly in the dirt. I knew they would not be for eating. The children were young and named Rose and Violet, after flowers. They hooted and laughed and chased the chickens, who flew up to the porch roof, then the dogs, who crept quietly under the porch. Seal had long ago fled to the barn to sleep in cool hay. Sarah and Maggie helped hitch the horses to the plow, then they set up a big table in the shade of the barn, covering it with a quilt and a kettle of flowers in the middle. They sat on the porch while Caleb and Matthew and Papa began their morning of plowing. I mixed biscuit dough just inside the door, watching. ""You are lonely, yes?"" asked Maggie in her soft voice. Sarah's eyes filled with tears. Slowly I stirred the dough. Maggie reached over and took Sarah's hand. ""I miss the hills of Tennessee sometimes,"" she said. Do not miss the hills, Maggie, I thought. ""I miss the sea,"" said Sarah. Do not miss the hills. Do not miss the sea. I stirred and stirred the dough. ""I miss my brother William,"" said Sarah. ""But he is married. The house is hers now. Not mine any longer. There are three old aunts who all squawk together like crows at dawn. I miss them, too.” ""There are always things to miss,"" said Maggie. ""No matter where you are."" I looked out and saw Papa and Matthew and Caleb working. Rose and Violet ran in the fields. I felt something brush my legs and looked down at Nick, wagging his tail. ""I would miss you, Nick,"" I whispered. ""I would."" I knelt down and scratched his ears. ""I miss Mama."" ""I nearly forgot,"" said Maggie on the porch. ""I have something more for you."" I carried the bowl outside and watched Maggie lift a low wooden box out of the wagon. ""Plants,"" she said to Sarah. ""For your garden."" ""My garden?"" Sarah bent down to touch the plants. ""Zinnias and marigolds and wild feverfew,"" said Maggie. ""You must have a garden. Wherever you are. Sarah smiled. ""I had a garden in Maine with dahlias and columbine. And nasturtiums the color of the sun when it sets. I don't know if nasturtiums would grow here."" ""Try,"" said Maggie. ""You must have a garden."" We planted the flowers by the porch, turning over the soil and patting it around them, and watering. Lottie and Nick came to sniff, and the chickens walked in the dirt, leaving prints. In the fields, the horses pulled the plow up and down under the hot summer sun. Maggie wiped her face, leaving a streak of dirt. ""Soon you can drive your wagon over to my house and I will give you more. I have tansy."" Sarah frowned. ""I have never driven a wagon."" “I can teach you,"" said Maggie. ""And so can Anna and Caleb. And Jacob."" Sarah turned to me. ""Can you?"" she asked. ""Can you drive a wagon? "" I nodded. ""And Caleb?"" ""Yes."" ""In Maine,"" said Sarah, ""I would walk to town."" ""Here it is different,"" said Maggie. ""Here you will drive."" Way off in the sky, clouds gathered. Matthew and Papa and Caleb came in from the fields, their work done. We all ate in the shade. ""We are glad you are here,"" said Matthew to Sarah. ""A new friend. Maggie misses her friends sometimes."" Sarah nodded. ""There is always something to miss, no matter where you are,"" she said, smiling at Maggie. Rose and Violet fell asleep in the grass, their bellies full of meat and greens and biscuits. And when it was time to go, Papa and Matthew lifted them into the wagon to sleep on blankets. Sarah walked slowly behind the wagon for a long time, waving, watching it disappear. Caleb and I ran to bring her back, the chickens running wildly behind us. ""What shall we name them?"" asked Sarah, laughing as the chickens followed us into the house. I smiled. I was right. The chickens would not be for eating. And then Papa came, just before the rain, bringing Sarah the first roses of summer. 8 The rain came and passed, but strange clouds hung in the northwest, low and black and green. And the air grew still. In the morning, Sarah dressed in a pair of over-alls and went to the barn to have an argument with Papa. She took apples for Old Bess and Jack. ""Women don't wear overalls,"" said Caleb, running along behind her like one of Sarah's chickens. ""This woman does,"" said Sarah crisply. Papa stood by the fence. “I want to learn how to ride a horse,"" Sarah told him. ""And then I want to learn how to drive the wagon. By myself."" Jack leaned over and nipped at Sarah's over-alls. She fed him an apple. Caleb and I stood behind Sarah. ""I can ride a horse, I know,"" said Sarah. ""I rode once when I was twelve. I will ride Jack."" Jack was Sarah's favorite. Papa shook his head. ""Not Jack,"" he said. ""Jack is sly."" ""I am sly, too,"" said Sarah stubbornly. Papa smiled. ""Ayuh,"" he said, nodding. ""But not Jack."" ""Yes, Jack!"" Sarah's voice was very loud. ""I can teach you how to drive a wagon. I have already taught you how to plow."" ""And then I can go to town. By myself."" ""Say no, Papa,"" Caleb whispered beside me. ""That's a fair thing, Sarah,"" said Papa. ""We'll practice."" A soft rumble of thunder sounded. Papa looked up at the clouds. ""Today' Can we begin today'"" asked Sarah. ""Tomorrow is best,"" said Papa, looking worried. ""I have to fix the house roof. A portion of it is loose. And there's a storm coming."" ""We,"" said Sarah. ""What?"" Papa turned. ""We will fix the roof,"" said Sarah. ""I've done it before. I know about roofs. I am a good carpenter. Remember, I told you?"" There was thunder again, and Papa went to get the ladder. ""Are you fast?"" he asked Sarah. ""I am fast and I am good,"" said Sarah. And they climbed the ladder to the roof, Sarah with wisps of hair around her face, her mouth full of nails, overalls like Papa's. Overalls that were Papa's. Caleb and I went inside to close the windows. We could hear the steady sound of hammers pounding the roof overhead. ""Why does she want to go to town by herself'"" asked Caleb. ""To leave us!"" I shook my head, weary with Caleb's questions. Tears gathered at the corners of my eyes. But there was no time to cry, for suddenly Papa called out. ""Caleb! Anna!"" We ran outside and saw a huge cloud, horribly black, moving toward us over the north fields. Papa slid down the roof, helping Sarah after him. ""A squall!"" he yelled to us. He held up his arms and Sarah jumped off the porch roof. ""Get the horses inside,"" he ordered Caleb. ""Get the sheep, Anna. And the cows. The barn is safest."" The grasses flattened. There was a hiss of wind, a sudden pungent smell. Our faces looked yellow in the strange light. Caleb and I jumped over the fence and found the animals huddled by the barn. I counted the sheep to make sure they were all there, and herded them into a large stall. A few raindrops came, gentle at first, then stronger and louder, so that Caleb and I covered our ears and stared at each other without speaking. Caleb looked frightened and I tried to smile at him. Sarah carried a sack into the barn, her hair wet and streaming down her neck, Papa came behind, Lottie and Nick with him, their ears hard against their heads. ""Wait!"" cried Sarah. ""My chickens!"" ""No, Sarah!"" Papa called after her. But Sarah had already run from the barn into a sheet of rain. My father followed her. The sheep nosed open their stall door and milled around the barn, bleating. Nick crept under my arm, and a lamb, Mattie with the black face, stood close to me, trembling. There was a soft paw on my lap, then a gray body. Seal. And then, as the thunder pounded and the wind rose and there was the terrible crackling of lightning close by, Sarah and Papa stood in the barn doorway, wet to the skin. Papa carried Sarah's chickens. Sarah came with an armful of summer roses. Sarah's chickens were not afraid, and they settled like small red bundles in the hay. Papa closed the door at last, shutting out some of the sounds of the storm. The barn was eerie and half lighted, like dusk without a lantern. Papa spread blankets around our shoulders and Sarah unpacked a bag of cheese and bread and jam. At the very bottom of the bag were Sarah's shells. Caleb got up and went over to the small barn window. ""What color is the sea when it storms?"" he asked Sarah. ""Blue,"" said Sarah, brushing her wet hair back with her fingers. ""And gray and green."" Caleb nodded and smiled. ""Look,"" he said to her. ""Look what is missing from your drawing."" Sarah went to stand between Caleb and Papa by the window. She looked a long time without speaking. Finally, she touched Papa's shoulder. ""We have squalls in Maine, too,"" she said. ""Just like this. It will be all right, Jacob."" Papa said nothing. But he put his arm around her, and leaned over to rest his chin in her hair. I closed my eyes, suddenly remembering Mama and Papa standing that way, Mama smaller than Sarah, her hair fair against Papa's shoulder. When I opened my eyes again, it was Sarah standing there. Caleb looked at me and smiled and smiled until he could smile no more. We slept in the hay all night, waking when the wind was wild, sleeping again when it was quiet. And at dawn there was the sudden sound of hail, like stones tossed against the barn. We stared out the window, watching the ice marbles bounce on the ground. And when it was over we opened the barn door and walked out into the early-morning light. The hail crunched and melted beneath our feet. It was white and gleaming for as far as we looked, like sun on glass. Like the sea. 9 It was very quiet. The dogs leaned down to eat the hailstones. Seal stepped around them and leaped up on the fence to groom herself. A tree had blown over near the cow pond. And the wild roses were scattered on the ground, as if a wedding had come and gone there. ""I'm glad I saved an armful"" was all that Sarah said. Only one field was badly damaged, and Sarah and Papa hitched up the horses and plowed and replanted during the next two days. The roof had held. ""I told you T know about roofs,"" Sarah told Papa, making him smile. Papa kept his promise to Sarah. When the work was done, he took her out into the fields, Papa riding Jack who was sly, and Sarah riding Old Bess. Sarah was quick to learn. ""Too quick,"" Caleb complained to me as we watched from the fence. He thought a moment. ""Maybe she'll fall off and have to stay here. Why'"" he asked, turning to me. ""Why does she have to go away alone?"" ""Hush up, Caleb,"" I said crossly. ""Hush up."" ""I could get sick and make her stay here,"" said Caleb . ""No."" ""We could tie her up."" ""No."" And Caleb began to cry, and I took him inside the barn where we could both cry. Papa and Sarah came to hitch the horses to the wagon, so Sarah could practice driving. Papa didn't see Caleb's tears, and he sent him with an ax to begin chopping up the tree by the pond for firewood. I stood and watched Sarah, the reins in her hands, Papa next to her in the wagon. I could see Caleb standing by the pond, one hand shading his eyes, watching, too. I went into the safe darkness of the barn then, Sarah's chickens scuttling along behind me. ""Why?"" I asked out loud, echoing Caleb's question. The chickens watched me, their eyes small and bright. The next morning Sarah got up early and put on her blue dress. She took apples to the barn. She loaded a bundle of hay on the wagon for Old Bess and Jack. She put on her yellow bonnet. ""Remember Jack,"" said Papa. ""A strong hand."" ""Yes, Jacob."" ""Best to be home before dark,"" said Papa. ""Driving a wagon is hard if there's no full moon."" ""Yes, Jacob."" Sarah kissed us all, even my father, who looked surprised. ""Take care of Seal,"" she said to Caleb and me. And with a whisper to Old Bess and a stern word to Jack, Sarah climbed up in the wagon and drove away. ""Very good,"" murmured Papa as he watched. And after a while he turned and went out into the fields. Caleb and I watched Sarah from the porch. Caleb took my hand, and the dogs lay down beside us. It was sunny, and I remembered another time when a wagon had taken Mama away. It had been a day just like this day. And Mama had never come back. Seal jumped up to the porch, her feet making a small thump. Caleb leaned down and picked her up and walked inside. I took the broom and slowly swept the porch. Then I watered Sarah's plants. Caleb cleaned out the wood stove and carried the ashes to the barn, spilling them so that I had to sweep the porch again. ""I am loud and pesky,"" Caleb cried suddenly. ""You said so! And she has gone to buy a train ticket to go away!'' ""No, Caleb. She would tell us."" ""The house is too small,"" said Caleb. ""That's what it is."" ""The house is not too small,"" I said. I looked at Sarah's drawing of the fields pinned up on the wall next to the window. ""What is missing?"" I asked Caleb. ""You said you knew what was missing."" ""Colors,"" said Caleb wearily. ""The colors of the sea."" Outside, clouds moved into the sky and went away again. We took lunch to Papa, cheese and bread and lemonade. Caleb nudged me. ""Ask him. Ask Papa."" ""What has Sarah gone to do?"" I asked. ""I don't know,"" said Papa. He squinted at me. Then he sighed and put one hand on Caleb's head, one on mine. ""Sarah is Sarah. She does things her way, you know."" ""I know,"" said Caleb very softly. Papa picked up his shovel and put on his hat. ""Ask if she's coming back,"" whispered Caleb. ""Of course she's coming back,"" I said. ""Seal is here."" But I would not ask the question. I was afraid to hear the answer. We fed the sheep, and I set the table for dinner. Four plates. The sun dropped low over the west fields. Lottie and Nick stood at the door, wagging their tails, asking for supper. Papa came to light the stove. And then it was dusk. Soon it would be dark. Caleb sat on the porch steps, turning his moon snail shell over and over in his hand. Seal brushed back and forth against him. Suddenly Lottie began to bark, and Nick jumped off the porch and ran down the road. ""Dust!"" cried Caleb. He climbed the porch and stood on the roof. ""Dust, and a yellow bonnet! "" Slowly the wagon came around the windmill and the barn and the windbreak and into the yard, the dogs jumping happily beside it. ""Hush, dogs,"" said Sarah. And Nick leaped up into the wagon to sit by Sarah. Papa took the reins and Sarah climbed down from the wagon. Caleb burst into tears. ""Seal was very worried! "" he cried. Sarah put her arms around him, and he wailed into her dress. ""And the house is too small, we thought! And I am loud and pesky!"" Sarah looked at Papa and me over Caleb's head. ""We thought you might be thinking of leaving us,"" I told her. ""Because you miss the sea."" Sarah smiled. ""No,"" she said. ""I will always miss my old home, but the truth of it is I would miss you more."" Papa smiled at Sarah, then he bent quickly to unhitch the horses from the wagon. He led them to the barn for water. Sarah handed me a package. ""For Anna,"" she said. ""And Caleb. For all of us.” The package was small, wrapped in brown paper with a rubber band around it. Very carefully I unwrapped it, Caleb peering closely. Inside were three colored pencils. ""Blue,"" said Caleb slowly, ""and gray. And green."" Sarah nodded. Suddenly Caleb grinned. ""Papa,"" he called. ""Papa, come quickly! Sarah has brought the sea! "" We eat our night meal by candlelight, the four of us, Sarah has brought candles from town, And nasturtium reeds for her garden, and a book of songs to teach us. It is late, and Caleb is nearly sleeping by his plate and Sarah is smiling at my father, Soon there will be a wedding, Papa says that when the preacher asks if he will have Sarah for his wife, he will answer, ""Ayuh,"" Autumn will come, then winter, cold with a wind that blows like the wind off the sea in Maine. There will be nests of curls to look for, and dried flowers all winter long. When there me storms, Papa will stretch a rope from the door to the barn so we will not be lost when we feed the sheep and the cotes and Jack and Old Bass, And Sarah's chickens, if they aren't living in the house. There will be Sarah's sea, blue and gray and green, hanging on the wall. And songs, old ones and new, And Seal with yellow eyes, And there will be Sarah, plain and tall."
19, Henry and Mudge: The First Book of Their Adventures,"Rylant, Cynthia",b024_HenryandMudge.txt,2,"Henry had no brothers and no sisters. “I want a brother,” he told his parents. “Sorry,” they said. Henry had no friends on his street. “I want to live on a different street,” he told his parents. “Sorry,” they said. Henry had no pets at home. “I want to have a dog,” he told his parents. “Sorry,” they almost said. But first they looked at their house with no brothers and sisters. Then they looked at their street with no children. Then they looked at Henry’s face. Then they looked at each other. “Okay,” they said. “I want to hug you!” Henry told his parents. And he did. Mudge Henry searched for a dog. “Not just any dog,” said Henry. “Not a short one,” he said. “Not a curly one,” he said. “And no pointed ears.” Then he found Mudge. Mudge had floppy ears, not pointed. And Mudge had straight fur, not curly. But Mudge was short. “Because he’ s a puppy,” Henry said. “He’ll grow.” And did he ever! He grew out of his puppy cage. He grew out of his dog cage. He grew out of seven collars in a row. And when he finally stopped growing. . .he weighed one hundred and eighty pounds, he stood three feet tall, and drooled. “I’m glad you’re not short,” Henry said. And Mudge licked him, then sat on him. Henry used to walk alone. When he walked he used to worry about tornadoes, ghosts, biting dogs, and bullies. He walked as fat as he could. He looked straight ahead. He never looked back. But now he walked to school with Mudge. And now when he walked, he thought about vanilla ice cream, rain, rocks and good dreams. He walked to school but not too fast. He walked to school and sometimes backwards. He walked to school and patted Mudge's big head, happy. Mudge Mudge loved Henry's room. He loved the diryt socks. He loved the stuffed bear. He loved the fish tank. But mostly he loved Henry's bed. Because in Henry's bed was Henry. Mdge loaved to climb in with Henry. Then he loved to smell him. He smelled his lemon hair. He smelled his milky mouth. He smelled his soapy ears. He smelled his chocolate fingers. Then he put his head by Henry's head. He looked at the fish tank. He looked at the bear. He looked at Henry. He licked him. And he fell asleep. Mudge One day Mudge took a walk without Henry. The sun was shining, the birds were flying, the grass smelled sweet. Mudge couldn't wait for Henry. So he left. He went down one road, sniffing the bushes, then down another road, kicking up dust. He went through a field, across a stream, into some pine trees. And when he came out on the other side, he was lost. He couldn't smell Henry. He couldn't smell his front porch. He couldn't smell the street he lived on. Mudge looked all around and didn't see anything or anyone he knew. He whined a little, alone without Henry. Then he lay down, alone without Henry. He missed Henry's bed. Henry Henry thought Mudge would be with him always. He thought Mudge made everything safe. He thought Mudge would never go away. And when Mudge did go away, when Henry called and called but Mudge didn't come, Henry's heart hurt and he cried for an hour. But when he finished crying, Henry said ""Mudge loves me. He wouldn't leave. He must be lost."" So Henry walked and walked, and he called and called, and he looked and looked for his dog Mudge. He walked down one road, then down another road. The sun shone as Henry ran through a field, calling and calling. The birds flew past as he stood beside a stream, calling and calling. And the tears fell again as he looked at the emply pine trees for his lost dog. ""Mudge!"" he called, one last time. And Mudge woke up from his lonely sleep, then came running. Every day when Henry woke up, he saw Mudge's big head. And every day when Mudge woke up, he saw Henry's small face. They ate breakfast at the same time; they ate supper at the same time. And when Henry was at school, Mudge just lay around and waited. Mudge never went for a walk without Henry again. And Henry never worried the Mudge would leave. Because sometimes, in thier dreams, they saw long silent roads, big wide fields, deep streams, and pine trees. In those dreams, Mudge was alone and Henry was alone. So when Mudge woke up and knew Henry was with him, he remembered the dream and stayed closer. And when Henry woke up and knew Mudge was with him, he remembered the dream and the looking and the calling and the fear and he knew he would never lose Mudge again."
20,Tops and Bottoms,"Stevens, Janet.",b025_TopsandBottoms.txt,2,"Once upon a time there lived a very lazy bear who had lots of money and lots of land. His father had been a hard worker and a smart business bear, and he had given all of his wealth to his son. But all Bear wanted to do was sleep. Not far down the road lived a hare. Although Hare was clever, he sometimes got into trouble. He had once owned land, too, but now he had nothing. He had lost a risky bet with a tortoise and had sold all of his land to Bear to pay off the debt. Hare and his family were in very bad shape. “The children are so hungry, Father Hare! We must think of something!” Mrs. Hare cried one day. So Hare and Mrs. Hare put their heads together and cooked up a plan. The next day Hare hopped down the road to Bear’s house. Bear, of course, was asleep. “Hello, Bear, wake up! It’s your neighbor, Hare, and I have an idea!” Bear opened one eye and grunted. “We can be business partners!” Hare said. “All we need is the field right here in front of your house. I’ll do the hard work of planting and harvesting, and we can split the profit right down the middle. Yes, sir, Bear, we’re in this together. I’ll work and you sleep.” 	 “Huh?” said Bear. “So, what will it be, Bear?” asked Hare. “The top half or the bottom half? It’s up to you – tops or bottoms.” “Uh, let’s see,” Bear said with a yawn. “I’ll take the top half, Hare. Right – tops.” Hare smiled. “It’s a done deal, Bear.” So Bear went back to sleep, and Hare and his family went to work. Hare planted, Mrs. Hare watered, and everyone weeded. Bear slept as the crops grew. When it was time for the harvest, Hare called out, “Wake up, Bear! You get the tops and I get the bottoms.” Hare and his family dug up the carrots, the radishes, and the beets. Hare plucked off all the tops, tossed them into a pile for Bear, and put the bottoms aside for himself. Bear stared at his pile. “But, Hare, all the best parts are in your half!” “You chose the tops, Bear,” Hare said. “Now, Hare, you’ve tricked me. You plant this field again – this this season I want the bottoms!” Hare agreed. “It’s a done deal, Bear.” So Bear went back to sleep, and Hare and his family went to work. They planted, watered, and weeded. Bear slept as the crops grew. When it was time for the harvest, Hare called out, “Wake up, Bear! You get the bottoms and I get the tops.” Hare and his family gathered up the lettuce, the broccoli, and the celery. Hare pulled off the bottoms for Bear and put the tops in his own pile. Bear looked at his pile and scowled. “Hare, you have cheated me again.” “But, Bear,” Hare said, “you wanted the bottoms this time.” Bear growled, “You plant this field again, Hare. You’ve tricked me twice, and you owe me one season of both tops and bottoms!” “You’re right, poor old Bear,” sighed Hare. “It’s only fair that you get both tops and bottoms this time. It’s a done deal, Bear.” So Bear went back to work. They planted, watered, and weeded, then watered and weeded some more. Bear slept as the crops grew. When it was time for the harvest, Hare called out, “Wake up, Bear! This time you get the tops and the bottoms!” There in front of Bear’s house lay a high field of corn. Hare and his family yanked up every cornstalk. Hare tugged off the rots at the bottom and the tassels at the top and put them in a pile for Bear. Then he carefully collected the ears of corn in the middle and placed them in his own pile. Bear rubbed his eyes and watched. “See, Bear? You get the tops and the bottoms. I get the middles. Yes, sir, Bear. It’s a done deal!” By now Bear was wide awake. “That’s it, Hare!” he hollered. “From now on I’ll plant my own crops and take the tops, bottoms, and middles!” Hare and his family scooped up the corn and hopped down the road toward home. Bear never again slept through a season of planting and harvesting. Hare bought back his land with the profit from the crops, and he and Mrs. Hare opened a vegetable stand. And although Hare and Bear learned to live happily as neighbors, they never because business partners again!"
21,The Raft,"LaMarche, Jim.",b026_TheRaft.txt,2,"There’s nobody to play with,” I complained. “She doesn’t even have a TV.” Dad grinned. “Well, she’s not your normal kind of grandma, I guess,” he said. “Calls herself a river rat.” He chuckled. “But I promise, she’ll find plenty for you to do. And you know I can’t take you with me this summer, Nicky. There’ll be no kids there, and I’ll be spending all my time at the plant.” I felt tears starting again, but I blinked hard and looked out the window. Th at afternoon, I stood in Grandma’s yard and watched my dad drive away. Dust rose up behind our car as it disappeared into the pines. “Well, we can’t stand here all summer,” said Grandma. “C’mon, Nicky, it’s time for supper.” “Honey or maple syrup on your cornbread?” Grandma asked. “I don’t like cornbread,” I mumbled, poking my finger into the syrup pitcher when she wasn’t looking. “If you’re going to do that, you’d better wash up first,” she said. She had eyes in the back of her head. “Bathroom’s through there.” I pushed the doorway curtain aside and walked into what would have been a living room in anyone else’s house. Books were scattered everywhere—on the tables, on the chairs, even on the floor. Three of the walls were cluttered with sketches and stuff ed fish and charts of the river. Several fi shing poles hung from the fourth with a tackle box, a snorkel, and a mask on the floor beneath them. It looked like a river rat’s workroom, all right, except that in the middle of everything was a half-finished carving of a bear. “Been carving that old fellow for years,” Grandma called from the kitchen. “Th e real one hangs out at the dump. Now come get your supper, before I feed it to him.” Dad was right—Grandma found plenty for me to do. In the morning, I stacked firewood, then helped her clean out the rain gutters and change the spark plugs on her truck. Th e afternoon was almost over when she handed me a cane pole, a bobber, and some red worms. “Fish fry tonight!” she said, showing me how to bait the hook. “Th at river’s full of fat bluegills. Drop your line near the lily pads and you’ll find’em.” Down at the dock, I looked things over. Th e lily pads were too close to shore. Th ere couldn’t be fish there. I walked to the end of the dock and threw my line out as far as I could. Then I sat down to wait. And wait. And wait. My bobber never moved. “There’s no fish in this stupid river,” I said out loud, disgusted. We had hamburgers for supper. “Give it another try,” said Grandma the next evening. “I’ll bet you catch something.” Don’t count on it, I thought, as I headed back to the dock. I threw my line in the water. Then I stretched out on the dock to wait. I must have fallen asleep, because I was awakened by loud chirping and chattering. I sat up and looked around. A flock of birds was moving toward me along the river, hovering over something floating on the water. It drifted downstream, closer and closer, until finally it bumped up against the dock. Though it was covered with leaves and branches, now I could tell that it was a raft. What was it doing floating down the river all by itself, I wondered. I reached down and pushed some of the leaves aside. Beneath them was a drawing of a rabbit. It looked like those ancient cave paintings I’d seen in books—just outlines, but wild and fast and free. I cleaned away more leaves and it was like finding presents under the Christmas tree. A bear, a fox, a raccoon—all with the wild look of the rabbit. Who had drawn them, I wondered. Where had the raft come from? I ran up to the cottage. Grandma was on the porch, reading. “Do you have some rope I can use?” I asked. “In the shed, hon,” she said. “Help yourself.” She didn’t ask me what I needed it for, and I decided not to tell her yet. I pushed the raft into the reeds along the river’s edge, then tied it to the dock so it wouldn’t drift away. All the while, birds flew over my head, every now and then swooping down to the raft as if it were a friend. A crane waded through the reeds to it. A turtle swam up from the bottom of the river. Th e moon had risen yellow over the river by the time I went up to the cottage to go to bed. I was already down at the dock the next morning when Grandma appeared with a life jacket and a long pole. She didn’t seem surprised by the raft at all, or by the animal pictures all over it. “How did you know . . . ?” I started. “Let’s go,” Grandma interrupted, tossing me the life jacket and stepping onto the raft . She pushed the pole hard into the river bottom and we moved smoothly into the current. “Your turn,” she said after a few minutes. She showed me how to hold the pole and push, and I poled us to the middle of the river. Even there, the water wasn’t over my head. We poled the raft up the river, then let it slowly drift back down. Th e birds kept us company the whole time, soaring, swooping, singing. Some even landed on the raft and rode with us for a while. Hitchhikers, Grandma called them. After that, I had little time for anything but the raft. I raced through whatever chores there were, then ran down to the dock, wondering what animals I’d see that day. It wasn’t just birds that the raft attracted. One morning three raccoons followed me along the shore. Another time a turtle climbed on board and spent the morning sunning itself. And one afternoon I saw a family of foxes slip through the trees along the river. When the weather turned too hot and sticky to sleep indoors, Grandma helped me put up a small tent on the raft. I lay on top of the cool sheets and read comic books by flashlight until I fell asleep. One night, a noise woke me up. Th ere in the moonlight stood a huge buck. He looked right at me, then lowered his head to drink, as if I wasn’t there at all. I found Grandma the next morning working on her bear carving. “Do you have some extra paper I could draw on?” I asked her. She brought out a big sketchpad and a pouch filled with thick pencils and crayons. “I’ve been saving these just for you,” she said. “Better take these, too.” She held out the snorkel and mask. “Never know when they might come in handy on a raft.” Th e sun was hot that afternoon, so I poled into the shade of a willow, then waited to see what animals the raft would bring. It wasn’t long before a great blue heron whooshed down with a crayfish in its bill. I grabbed a pencil and began to sketch. I felt invisible as the bird calmly ate its lunch right in front of me. Then it preened its feathers, looked back up the river, and flew off. Th at night I showed my drawing to Grandma. “Not bad,” she said. “Not bad at all!” And she tacked it on the wall on top of one of her own sketches. Character, Setting Describe the ways in which Nicky is beginning to enjoy the place where his grandmother lives. One day I poled upriver farther than I’d ever been. Near a clump of tall cattails, I startled an otter family. They dove underwater, but, as with the other animals, the raft seemed to calm them down. Soon they were playing all around me. Grandma had been right about the mask and snorkel coming in handy. I slipped them on, then hung my head over the raft and watched the otters play—chasing fish, chasing each other, sometimes just chasing their own tails. I kept very still, but they didn’t seem to mind me watching. They played keep away with a small stone, then tug-of-war with a piece of rope. It was like they were showing off for me. They even let me feed them right out of my hand. Some mornings, Grandma would make a bagful of sandwiches and a thermos of icy lemonade. Then we’d put on our bathing suits, grab some towels, a lawn chair, and an inner tube, and pole upriver to her favorite swimming spot. “I’ve come swimming here since I was a girl,” she told me as we tied the raft to an old dock. “Th e Marshalls used to live here—all ten of them. What a herd of wild animals we were!” While Grandma watched from the inner tube, I practiced my flying cannonballs. Then we’d eat our lunch, and she’d tell me stories about growing up on the river. My favorite was of the time she’d found a small black pearl inside a river clam. “I still have it,” she said. Somehow, on the river, it seemed like summer would never end. But of course it did. On my last day, I got up extra early and crept down to the dock. Th e air was cool and a low pearly fog hung over the river. I untied the raft and quietly drift ed downstream. Ahead of me, through the fog, I saw two deer moving across the river, a doe and her fawn. When they reached the shore, the doe leaped easily up the steep bank, then turned to wait for her baby. But the fawn was in trouble. It kept slipping down the muddy bank. Th e doe returned to the water to help, but the more the fawn struggled, the deeper it got stuck in the mud. I pushed off the river bottom and drove the raft hard onto the muddy bank, startling the doe. Then I dropped into the water. I was ankle-deep in mud. “You’re okay,” I whispered to the fawn, praying that the raft would calm it. “I won’t hurt you.” Gradually the fawn stopped struggling, as if it understood that I was there to help. I put my arms around it and pulled. It barely moved. I pulled again, then again. Slowly the fawn eased out of the mud, and finally it was free. Carefully I carried the fawn up the bank to its mother. Then, quietly, I returned to the raft. From there, I watched the doe nuzzle and clean her baby, and I knew what I had to do. I pulled the stub of a crayon from my pocket, and drew the fawn, in all its wildness, onto the old gray boards of the raft. When I had finished, I knew it was just right. After supper, I showed Grandma my drawing of the fawn and told her my story. “It’s perfect,” she said, “but we need to do one more thing.” She hurried up to the cottage. When she came back, she had tubes of oil paint and two brushes. Grandma helped me trace my drawing with the oil paint, which soaked deep into the wood. “That’ll keep it,” she said. “Now you’ll always be part of the river.” “Just like you, Grandma,” I told her. “A river rat.” Grandma laughed. “Just like me,” she agreed."
22, Poppleton in Winter,"Rylant, Cynthia. ",b027_PoppletoninWinter.txt,2,"It was a very snowy day and Poppleton felt like a sleigh ride. He called his friend Cherry Sue. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry, Poppleton, I’m making cookies,” said Cherry Sue. Poppleton called his friend Hudson. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry,” said Hudson, “I’m baking a cake.” Poppleton called his friend Fillmore. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry,” said Fillmore. “I’m stirring some fudge.” Poppleton was disappointed. He couldn’t find one friend for a sleigh ride. And besides that, they were all making such good things to eat! He sat in front of his window, feeling very sorry for himself. Suddenly the doorbell rang. “SURPRISE!” There stood all of Poppleton’s friends! With cookies and cake and fudge and presents! “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, POPPLETON!” He had forgotten his own birthday! Everyone ate and laughed and played games with Poppleton. Then, just before midnight, they all took him on a sleigh ride. The moon was full and white. The stars twinkled. The owls hooted in the trees. Over the snow went the sleigh filled with Poppleton and all of his friends. Poppleton didn’t even make a birthday wish. He had everything already."
23,The Lighthouse Family: The Storm,"Rylant, Cynthia. ",b028_TheLighthouseFamilyTheStorm.txt,2," In a lonely lighthouse, far from city and town, far from the comfort of friends, lived a kindhearted cat named Pandora.

  She had been living at this lighthouse all alone for four long years, and it was beginning to wear. She found herself sighing long, deep, lonely sighs. She sat on the rocks overlooking the waves far too long. Sometimes her nose got a sunburn.

  And at night, when she tried to read by the lantern light, her mind wandered and she would think for hours on her childhood when she had friends and company.

  Why did Pandora accept this lonely lighthouse life?

  Because a lighthouse had once saved her.

  When Pandora was but a kitten, she and her father had gone sailing aboard a grand schooner, bound for a new country. Pandora’s mother had stayed behind, with the baby, to join them later.

  And while they were at sea, Pandora and her father were shaken from their beds one night by an awful twisting of the ship’s great bow.

  “Stay here, Pandora!” her father had commanded. “Stay here and wait until I come for you!”

  They were in a terrible storm. The wind was howling, and the waves crashed hard upon them. Worse, a deep fog had spread itself all over the water, and it is fog that will bring a ship to its end. Fog that will blind a sailor’s eyes until his ship has hit the jagged shore and torn itself to pieces.

  Pandora’s father knew this as he strained with the others to keep the ship’s sails aloft and his daughter trembled in her bed. He knew what somber danger they were in.

  But Pandora’s father was a brave cat and he would not give up hope. He would hold tight to the riggings with the others until help, in whatever form, might come to them.

  In time, the winds began to settle and the waves grew smaller. But the dense fog refused to lift.

  The ship’s captain was clearly worried. For he knew these waters they sailed in. He knew the long history of ships gone down.

  And he carried little hope that help might come to them, that someone might lead them away from the deadly shore. For only a lighthouse might show them the way, and there had been no working light on these waters for a hundred years.

  So it was with much bewilderment, and amazement, and overwhelming joy that he heard, first, the deep, clear sound of a foghorn, then saw before him a light. Yes, a light! And it was not the light of another ship or small boat. Only a very powerful lamp could make itself seen through a fog like this. Only the lamp of a lighthouse.

  “Pull leeward!” cried the captain. “Away from the light!”

  And everyone pulled hard on the riggings to make the ship turn, turn away from the dangerous shore.

  The ship, and everyone on it, was saved.

  Ever after, Pandora dreamed of lighthouses. Though she had not seen the beacon that had saved her, her father had, and he spoke of it often. He always wondered who had made the great light shine.

  As she grew, Pandora herself came to think much on this. She went to the library and gathered books on lighthouses. She drew them in her sketch pad. She dreamed of them at night.

  Then one morning she awoke and she knew what she must do. She must become a lighthouse keeper! She knew that this was her destiny.

  It did not take Pandora long to find a lighthouse in need of keeping. It is a hard and lonely job, and few want it. Lighthouses are often built in unwelcoming places, atop sharp and dangerous rocks. A winter storm can hold a keeper inside for weeks on end. And when she finally emerges, there is no one to talk to. They are all someplace else, living in little towns or big cities. They are not interested in desolation.

  But Pandora was not afraid of this life, for her heart was so good and clear that fear would not creep inside it. The ships in those unpredictable waters carried fathers and mothers and children, and they needed guiding. She knew she could do it.

  And Pandora had been doing it, faithfully, for four long years. She had seen many an awful storm come and go. She had stayed awake long winter nights, tending the great lamp, sounding the deep horn.

  Pandora did not know how many lives she had saved. But she knew that she had saved some.

  And now, weary with being alone for so long, Pandora was about to save one more.

  There are those who love the sea so deeply, they cannot bear to be away from it even for a day. A dog named Seabold was one of these. He was born to a sailor’s life.

  When Seabold was old enough to leave home and family, he built himself a boat—which he named Adventure—said good-bye to his parents and sisters, and off he went, in search of the life meant for him.

  He was a fine sailor. He had a keen understanding of the wind. He could read the stars. And he trusted his instincts.

  For five years Seabold sailed the world’s great oceans, and his instincts never failed him. He sailed safe and strong and free of worry.

  But one day, this all changed.

  Seabold had always known when a storm was coming. His nose told him so. And he had always found a sheltered cove or harbor in which to wait out the rough seas.

  But this day, he had a cold. He had a cold and a stuffy nose, and his sense of smell was very bad. Added to this, he was tired. Seabold took a long, long nap in his bunk, and he did not notice the seabirds nervously circling in the air above him, agitated and calling to one another about the bad weather ahead.

  The seabirds all wisely headed for land. But Seabold, adrift in his dreams, stayed out on open water.

  Then the great storm hit.

  Seabold was jolted from sleep by a sharp crack of lightning, a deep roar of thunder, and an enormous, crashing wave. As Adventure was flung here and there, up and down, Seabold clung to the little boat with all his strength, for there was nothing else he could do.

  The sea, which had always been his friend, had turned against him. And for the first time in his sailor’s life, Seabold was afraid.

  He whispered into the wind, “Safe harbor. Let there be safe harbor.”

  Just as Seabold whispered these words, a magnificent light broke through the darkness, and the long, distant call of a horn sounded across the water.

  “Safe harbor,” Seabold repeated.

  And this was the last thing brave Seabold said before he was lifted and rolled, over and over, into the deep black sea.

  One might have thought the dog was forever lost.

  But this is not the end of Seabold’s story.

  When Seabold next awoke, he wondered if perhaps the storm had been just a dream.

  For he found himself in a little wooden bed under a cheerful gingham quilt, and he was no longer in the sea, but looking out at the sea, through a small window by his side. A daisy stood in a jar on the windowsill.

  Seabold tapped his head to be sure he wasn’t dreaming. And just as he was about to try his legs on the shiny wooden floor, the door to his room opened and in stepped a cat.

  She was smiling and had an apron tied around her waist. In her hands was a tray of tea and biscuits.

  “Good morning,” she said, setting the tray on the table beside the bed. “I hoped you might be awake. I am Pandora.”

  Still unsure whether he was dreaming, Seabold extended his paw to shake hers. “And I am Seabold,” he said. “At least, I think I am.”

  Pandora smiled. “You have had a rather bad journey,” she said.

  “I thought it was my last,” answered Seabold.

  Pandora poured him a cup of tea, which

smelled like flowers. Seabold drank it gratefully. “Thank you,” he said. “May I have more? I’m so thirsty.”

  Pandora nodded and poured another cup. “All that salt water,” she said.

  “I don’t know how I am alive,” said Seabold.

  “Nor do I,” said Pandora. “When I found you on the shore three days ago, I was certain you were dead.”

  “I’ve been here three days?” exclaimed Seabold.

  “Yes.” Pandora smiled. “Sleeping like a baby.”

  Seabold shook his head. “I remember only going under,” he said. “My boat—have you seen her?”

  “Not yet,” said Pandora. “But it may be farther down the shore. When you are able to walk, we shall go search.”

  “Able to walk?” said Seabold.

  “Your leg,” said Pandora.

  Seabold drew back the gingham quilt. With surprise, he saw that his left leg was bandaged and splinted knee to foot. “Heavens,” he said. “But, there is no pain. Shouldn’t I be suffering?”

  Pandora smiled with pleasure. “I am something of a doctor, I suppose,” she said. “I have studied plants and learned those that heal. I wrapped your leg in plantain leaves to relieve the swelling. And the splint will prevent further injury.”

  “Amazing!” said Seabold.

  Pandora blushed with pride.

  “And are you alone here?” asked Seabold, sipping his tea. Pandora had poured herself a cup.

  “Yes, all alone,” she said. “Although I do have friends who stop by this island once in a while. In a very long while, I should say. They are seasonal.”

  “Seasonal?” said Seabold.

  “They migrate,” said Pandora. “So I see them only in spring and fall, as they make their way north or south. There is Atoll, the gray whale . . .”

  “You know a whale personally?” asked Seabold.

  “Oh yes,” said Pandora. “Whales are very sociable once you break the ice. Ask them about their children and they’ll go on forever.”

  “There is also Henry, the tern,” she continued. “He’s usually so pressed for time, he doesn’t even land. He simply flutters above my head and asks after my health, my garden, and so forth. Then he’s off. He flies six thousand miles every year.”

  “Really?” said Seabold.

  “Yes,” said Pandora. “He’s quite fit.”

  “But you are alone nearly always?” asked Seabold.

  “Nearly always,” said Pandora.

  Seabold shook his head. “I never thought I would meet someone else like me,” he said.

  “Like you?” asked Pandora.

  “One who loves the solitary life,” said Seabold. “I am nearly always at sea, nearly always alone. Like you.”

  Pandora smiled and thought a moment. “I am not sure I love the solitary life,” she said finally. “I simply live it.”

  “And why?” asked Seabold.

  “To save lives,” said Pandora. “Like yours.”

  And she poured him another cup of tea.

  Everything at the lighthouse was different after Seabold’s arrival.

  Mornings when Pandora awoke, she remembered she had someone else to talk to. She leaped from bed and prepared a big breakfast of hot wheat cereal with cream, and apple scones, and bowls of huckleberries. She carried the tray to Seabold’s room, and there they chatted all morning. Pandora’s garden grew very weedy.

  Then, once Seabold was able to hobble about on his leg with the help of a walking stick, their talks moved outside. Sitting on large rocks by the water, Pandora and Seabold told each other stories of their lives and things they had read or seen and what they liked most in this world or least.

  Seabold told of his father, who feared the water and would not set foot in a boat.

  Pandora told of her younger sister, who sewed wedding gowns for queens.

  They both had read fairy tales as children and agreed that the bad animals were more interesting than the good ones.

  And what did they like best in the world?

  The northern lights, said Seabold.

  Penguins, said Pandora.

  Least, they both agreed, were shipwrecks.

  It was summer, and Pandora’s lighthouse responsibilities were small. For two months—July and August—there was little rain and hardly any fog. Ships traveled safely, and Pandora got a rest.

  Well, somewhat. She still had to tend to preparing for the hard winter ahead. She knew she must grow and harvest vegetables, grind corn and wheat for bread, collect and cut driftwood for the fire. A supply boat had already delivered the year’s kerosene for the lighthouse. All depended on Pandora being ready.

  While Pandora gardened in the day, Seabold worked—as best he could, given his leg—on rebuilding his boat. He had indeed found it—at least, most of it—farther down the shore, and though his heart broke to see it so battered, he believed he could save it.

  As Pandora gardened, she watched Seabold off in the distance tending to his boat, and she felt a small emptiness in her heart. The emptiness one feels watching a dear friend prepare to go away.

  Evenings, the two made a picnic on the hill of daises leading to the shore and watched the sun go down, painting the world pink and red.

  The next day, it all began again.

  Seabold was very curious about the workings of the lighthouse, but his leg would not permit him to climb the four steep flights of stairs, then the ladder up into the lantern room to reach the great glass lamp. With no storms and no need for the saving lamp, Seabold sometimes forgot there was any lighthouse at all.

  But one day in early September, just as the geese and the mallards and the warblers were beginning to fly overhead on their long journeys south, Seabold was awakened to exactly what that enormous lighthouse was meant to do.

  And to just who was prepared to do it.

  It was much too early in the season, Pandora thought, for a storm to blow in. It was the season for fog, yes, but for serious ocean storms . . . those were due much later in the fall.

  Then why, she wondered one afternoon in early September as she gathered tomatoes off the vines, was the sky growing so black? Why was the air so cold? Why were gulls circling higher and higher, their cries growing more and more frantic?

  Because a sky above a sea loves unpredictability. It loves to surprise.

  This day, it clearly intended to.

  Seabold and Pandora battened down his boat, secured the shutters over the cottage windows, and set to building a fire in the kitchen stove.

  “How cold it is!” said Seabold. “And yesterday was so warm.”

  “The sea is bringing us a different air,” said Pandora. “One, I believe, full of danger. I must go up to the lantern room and attend to the light.”

  Seabold looked at his still-splinted leg in frustration. “I have to get up there to help you,” he said.

  “No, no,” said Pandora. “Injury to your leg now will set you back a month of healing. Just keep the fire going while I work.”

  And while Seabold fed the fire in the kitchen and kept a pot of tea hot and ready for them both, Pandora climbed up to the lantern room. She trimmed the great lamp’s wicks and lit them. She checked the kerosene vessel. She cleaned the storm panes. Then she climbed down to the watch room.

  Just around suppertime, an enormous fog bank began rolling in. High in her tower, Pandora watched it spread toward land like creeping cotton, and she began to ring the bells and sound the horn that would guide smaller boats to shore, giving them escape from the storm that was surely about to hit.

  Down in the kitchen, Seabold fretted. He listened to the bells and the horn. I could be doing that, he thought. I could be helping. But he had to sit there by the fire and wait. He was miserable.

  Over the next few hours the wind built to an astonishing speed, and its gusts rocked the tower Pandora worked in. She was undaunted. It was nightfall now, and this was a very bad storm for any ship at sea. Fog, lightning, lashing rain, hard wind—all could lead a ship on

to the rocks and sink her.

  Pandora worked in the watch room, sounding the horn again and again. Above her the great light kept its strong beam out upon the water. She was cold—she’d had no time to dress warmly or carry wood to the watch room stove. But she could not stop to remedy this. It was a terrible storm, and she knew what a terrible storm could do.

  In the kitchen, Seabold sat at the window and watched the great light shine and listened to the warning horn.

  One hour, two hours, three hours, four hours . . . How did Pandora do it? Where did she find the strength? He was only tending the kitchen fire and already he was tired.

  Finally, sleep got the better of him. The storm raged on, without his witness.

  Bright sun shining into the kitchen woke Seabold the next morning. He had lain beside the stove all night. And where was Pandora? He looked out the window.

  And there she was, far out near the edge of a cliff, a shawl about her shoulders and her paw in the air, waving.

  Off in the water, barely a spot on the horizon, was a sailing ship. At rest. Safe.

  She saved them, thought Seabold.

  He watched his friend in wonder.

  Seabold had planned to sail away by October’s end, before the hard winter storms began, before the ice and wind. He was a sailing dog, the sea was his home. He knew this and Pandora knew this, and they both were prepared for the sorrowful good-bye.

  But destiny had other plans.

  Seabold’s boat did not come together as quickly as he’d hoped. Small essential pieces were still missing and had to be made by hand. This would take time. It would take a long spring and a long summer and perhaps an entire fall as well.

  Seabold was resourceful. But he could not invent time.

  And his leg was very slow in healing. It had been a bad break, and in spite of Pandora’s marvelous herbs and capable splinting, the leg was weak. Seabold still walked with the aid of a stick.

24,The One-Eyed Giant (Book One of Tales from the Odyssey),"Osborne, Mary Pope",b029_TheOneEyed.txt,2,"A hideous giant lumbered into the clearing. He carried nearly half a forest’s worth of wood on his back. His monstrous head jutted from his body like a shaggy mountain peak. A single eye bulged in the center of his forehead. The monster was Polyphemus. He was the most savage of all the Cyclopes, a race of fierce one-eyed giants who lived without laws or leader. The Cyclopes were ruthless creatures who were known to capture and devour any sailors who happened near their shores. Polyphemus threw down his pile of wood. As it crashed to the ground, Odysseus and his men fled to the darkest corners of the cave. Unaware that the Greeks were hiding inside, Polyphemus drove his animals into the cave. Then he rolled a huge boulder over its mouth to block out the light of day and imprison his flock inside. Twenty-four wagons could not haul that rock away, Odysseus thought desperately. How will we escape this monster? Odysseus’ men trembled with terror as the giant made a small fire and milked his goats in the shadowy light. His milking done, he threw more wood on his fire. The flame blazed brightly, lighting up the corners of the cave where Odysseus and his men were hiding. “What’s this? Who are you? From where do you come?” the giant boomed. He glared at the Greeks with his single eye. “Are you pirates who steal the treasure of others?” Odysseus’ men were frozen with terror. But Odysseus hid his own fear and stepped toward the monster. “We are not pirates,” he said, “We are Greeks blown off course by storm winds. Will you offer us the gift of hospitality like a good host? If you do, mighty Zeus, king of the gods, will be pleased. Zeus is the guardian of all strangers.” “Fool!” the giant growled. “Who are you to tell me to please Zeus? I am a son of Poseidon, god of the seas! I am not afraid of Zeus!” Odysseus men cowered in fear. Polyphemus moved closer to Odysseus. He spoke in a soft, terrible voice. “But tell me, stranger, where is your ship? Near or far from shore?” Odysseus knew Polyphemus was trying to trap him. “Our ship was destroyed in the storm,” he lied. “It was dashed against the rocks. With these good men I escaped, I ask you again, will you welcome us?”"

He stopped at the creek and took a drink. “Are you ready now?” asked Cowgirl Kate. “No,” said Cocoa. “Now I am hungry.” Cowgirl Kate gave him an apple. He ate it in one bite. Then he sniffed the saddlebag. Cowgirl Kate gave him another apple. He ate that in one bite, too. He sniffed the saddlebag again. “You are a pig,” said Cowgirl Kate. “No,” said Cocoa. “I am a horse.” “A cowhorse?” she asked. “Of course,” he said. “But a cowhorse herds cows,” she said. “Just now, I am too full,” he said. Cowgirl Kate smiled. “Then I will tell you a story.” “Once there was a cowgirl who needed a cowhorse. She went to a ranch and saw lots and lots of horses. Then she saw a horse whose coat was the color of chocolate. His tail and mane were the color of caramel. ‘Yum,’ said the cowgirl, ‘you are the colors of my favorite candy.’ The horse looked at her. He sniffed her.” “’Are you a real cowgirl?’ he asked. ‘I am a cowgirl from the boots up,’ she said. ‘Well, I am a cowhorse from the mane down,’ he said. ‘Will you work hard every day?’ the cowgirl asked.. The horse raised his head high. ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘a cowhorse always does his job.’ ‘At last,’ said the cowgirl, ‘I have found my horse.’” “That was a good story,” said Cocoa.

The king traveled with his Queen, his knights, squires, and other members of his court. There could be a hundred mouths to feed! Preparations for the visit began at once. The lord and lady of the manor had their serfs to help them. The serfs lived in huts provided for them on the lord’s estate, each with its own plot of land. In return, they were bound to serve the lord. They farmed his land, managed his manor house, and if there was a war, they had to go to battle with the lord and the King. But now they prepared. The manor had its own church, which was attended by everyone on the estate. The manor house had to be cleaned, the rooms readied, tents set up for the horsemen, fields fenced for the horses. And above all, provisions had to be gathered for the great feast. The Royal Suite was redecorated. Silk was spun, new fabric was woven. The Royal Crest was embroidered on linen and painted on the King’s chair. The lord and his party went hunting and hawking for fresh meat. Hunting was a sport for the rich only. The wild animals that lived on the lord’s estate belonged to him. Anyone caught poaching—hunting illegally—was severely punished. Falcons and hawks were prizeds pets. They were trained to attack birds for their masters to capture. They trapped rabbits and birds of all kinds, and fished for salmon and eels and trout. Serfs hid in bushes and caught birds in traps. They set ferrets in burrows to chase out rabbits. There were fruits and vegetables growing in the garden, herbs and flowers for sauces and salads, and bees made honey for sweetening."

A root grows down into the soil. The root takes in water and minerals from the soil for food. The plant grows bigger and bigger. The leaves make food for the plant from the water and minerals in the soil, the sunlight, and the air all around the plant. Bees, other insects and hummingbirds help pollinate, too. While they visit flowers for their sweet juice, called nectar, pollen rubs onto their bodies. Before a seed can begin to grow, a grain of pollen from the stamen must land on the stigma at the top of the pistil of a flower like itself. This is called pollination. "

31, So You Want to Be President?,"St George, Judith",b037_SoYouWanttoBePresident.txt,2,"There are good things about being President. One of the good things is that the President lives in a big white house called the White House. Another good thing about being President is that the President has a swimming pool, bowling alley, and movie theater. The President never has to take out the garbage. The President doesn’t have to eat yucky vegetables. As a boy, George Bush had to eat broccoli. When George Bush grew up, he became President. That was the end of the broccoli. One of the bad things about being President is that the President always has to be dressed up. William McKinley wore a frock coat, vest, pin-stripped trousers, stiff white shirt, black satin tie, gloves, a top hat, and a red carnation in his buttonhole every day. The President has to be polite to everyone. The President can’t go anywhere alone. The President has lots of homework. People get mad at the President. Someone once threw a cabbage at William Howard Taft. That didn’t bother Taft. He quipped, “I see that one of my adversaries has lost his head.” Lots of people want to be President. If you want to be President, it might help if your name is James. Six Presidents were named James. (President Carter liked to be called Jimmy). There were four Johns, four Williams (President Clinton liked to be called Bill), two Georges, two Andrews, and two Franklins – all became President. You probably weren’t born in a log cabin. That’s too bad. People are crazy about log-cabin Presidents. They elected eight. William Harrison was born in a big Virginia mansion, though he won the election with a “log cabin and hard cider” slogan. If you want to be President, your size doesn’t matter. Presidents have come in all shapes and sizes. Abraham Lincoln was the tallest – six feet four inches. (His stovepipe hat made him look even taller.) James Madison was the smallest – five feet four inches and only one hundred pounds. William Howard Taft was the biggest – more than three hundred pounds. He was so big that he had a special tub built for his White House bathroom. (Four men could fit in the tub!) Maybe Taft’s problem was that Presidents can order any food they want. Andrew Johnson once served his guests turtle soup, oysters, fish, beef, turkey, chicken, mutton chops, mushrooms, string beans, duck, partridges, pudding, jellies, and lots of wine. All at one dinner. Though the Constitution says you’ll have to wait until you’re thirty-five, young, old, and in between have become President. Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt at forty-two was the youngest. He had pillow fights with his children and played football on the White House lawn. Ronald Reagan was the oldest. When he first ran for President, he wad sixty-nine. He joked that it was the thirtieth anniversary of his thirty-ninth birthday. Some Presidents joked and some didn’t – Presidents’ personalities have all been different. William McKinley was so nice that he tried to stop a mob from attacking the man who had just shot him. Don’t worry about your looks. Abraham Lincoln was a homely man, but he was one of our best Presidents. William Hardy was a handsome man, but he was one of our worst presidents. Do you have pesky brothers and sisters? Every one of our Presidents did. Benjamin Harrison had eleven! (It’s lucky he grew up on a six-hundred-acre farm.) Do you have a pet? All kinds of pets have lived in the White House. Theodore Roosevelt’s children just didn’t have pets, they ran a zoo. They had dogs, cats, guinea pigs, snakes, mice, rats, badgers, raccoons, parrots, and a Shetland pony. Some Presidents played a musical instrument. Some knew how to dance. Some played sports, and some went to college. Andrew Johnson couldn’t read until he was fourteen! He didn’t learn to write until after he was married! Almost any job can lead to the White House. Presidents have been lawyers, teachers, farmers, sailors, engineers, surveyors, mayors, governors, congressmen, senators, and ambassadors. Harry Truman owned a men’s store. Andrew Jackson was a tailor. Ronald Regan was a movie actor. Every single President has taken this oath: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will do to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Tall, short, fat, thin, talkative, quiet, vain, humble, lawyer, teacher, or soldier – this is what most of our Presidents have tried to do, each in his own way. Some succeeded. Some failed. So if you want to be President – a good President – pattern yourself after the best. Our best have had the courage, spirit, and will to do what they knew was right. Most of all, their first priority has always been the people and the country they served."
32,"Boy, Were We Wrong About Dinosaurs","Kudlinski, Kathleen V",b039_BoyWereWeWrongAboutDinosaurs.txt,2,"Long, long ago, before people knew anything about dinosaurs, giant bones were found in China. Wise men who saw the bones tried to guess what sort of enormous animal they could have come from. After they studied the fossil bones, the ancient Chinese decided that they came from dragons. They thought these dragons must have been magic dragons to be so large. And they believed that dragons could still be alive. Boy, were they wrong! No one knows exactly what dinosaurs looked like. All that is left of them are fossil bones and a few other clues. Now that we think that many of our own past guesses about dinosaurs were just as wrong as those of ancient China. Some of our mistakes were little ones. When the first fossil bones of Iguanodon were found, one was shaped like a rhino’s horn. Scientists guessed that the strange horn fit like a spike on Iguanodon’s nose Boy, were we wrong about Iguanodon! When a full set of fossil bones was found later, there were two pointed bones, they were part of Iguanodon’s hands, not its nose! Other new clues show us that we may have been wrong about every kind of dinosaur. Some of our first drawings of dinosaurs showed them with their elbows and knees pointing out to the side, like a lizard’s. With legs like that, big dinosaurs could only waddle clumsily on all fours or float underwater. Now we know that their legs were straight under them, like a horse’s. Dinosaurs were not clumsy. The sizes and shapes of their leg bones see to show that some were as fast and graceful as deer."
33,Bat Loves the Night,"Davies, Nicola",b040_BatLovestheNight.txt,2,"Bat is waking, upside down as usual, hanging by her toenails. Her beady eyes open. Her pixie ears twitch. 
She shakes her thistledown fur. 
She unfurls her wings, made of skin so fine the finger bones inside show through. 
Out under the broken tile into the nighttime garden. Over bushes, under trees, between fence posts, through the tangled hedge she swoops untouched. Bat is at home in the darkness as a fish is in the water. She doesn't need to see—she can hear where she is going. 
Bat shouts as she flies, louder than a hammer blow, higher than a squeak. She beams her voice around her like a flashlight, and the echoes come singing back. They carry a sound picture of all her voice has touched. Listening hard, Bat can hear every detail, the smallest twigs, the shape of leaves. 
Baby bats can't fly. Sometimes mother bats carry their babies when they go out, but mostly the babies stay behind in the roost and crowd together to keep warm. 
Inside, there are squeakings. Fifty hungry batlings hang in a huddle, hooked to a rafter by oversized feet. Bat lands and pushes in among them, toes first, upside down again. 

Baby bats drink mother's milk until they learn to fly at a few weeks old. Then they can leave the roost at night to find their own food. 
Bat knows her baby's voice, and calls to it. The velvet scrap batling climbs aboard and clings to Bat's fur by its coat-hanger feet. Wrapped in her leathery wings, the baby snuggles to sleep.

The astronauts squeeze in to Columbia’s sideways seats, lying on their backs, facing toward the sky—Neil Armstrong on the left, Michael Collins in the right, Buzz Aldrin in the middle. Click and they fasten straps. Click and the hatch is sealed. There they wait, while the Saturn hums beneath them. Near the rocket, in Launch Control, and far away in Houston, in Mission Control, there are numbers, screens, and charts, ways of watching and checking every piece of the rocket and ships, the fuel, the valves, the pipes, the engines, the beats of the astronauts’ hearts.

For the first time, he sees bright sunlight and feels the wind ruffle his fur. The cub tumbles and slides down icy hills. His play makes him strong and teaches him to walk and run in snow. Like his mother, the cub is built to survive in the Arctic. Hi white fur will grow to be six inches thick—longer than your hand. The skin beneath the cub’s fur is black. It soaks up the heat of the sun. Under the skin is a layer of fat. Like a snug blanket, this blubber keeps in the heat of the bear’s body. Polar bears get too hot more easily than they get too cold. They stretch out on the ice to cool off."

Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.

It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.

However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.


“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.

“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!”

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.


CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears
“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.,
       Hearthrug,
         near the Fender,
           (with Alice’s love).
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—

“How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

“How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!”

“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.

“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”

“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”

“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.”

“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!”

“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.

CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”

“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.

“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?”

“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.

“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”

“Found what?” said the Duck.

“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.”

“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?”

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.

“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.”

“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”

“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.

“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”

“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”

“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.

“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.

“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.

“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.

“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.

“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.

“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.

“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—

         “Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     ‘Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.’
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, ‘Such
        a trial,
         dear sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.’
        ‘I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,’
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          ‘I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.’”
“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are you thinking of?”

“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth bend, I think?”

“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”

“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”

“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended, you know!”

The Mouse only growled in reply.

“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”

“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”

“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.

CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.

“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.

“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!”

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?”

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.”

“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”

“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!”

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”

“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”

“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and help me out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)

“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”

“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)

“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!”

“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”

“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!”

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do it!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!”

“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”

“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.

“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”

“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.

“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?”

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”

“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”

“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”

“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.

“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”

“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.

“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”

“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.

“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.”

“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.”

“Why?” said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something important to say!”

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.

“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.

“No,” said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?”

“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”

“Can’t remember what things?” said the Caterpillar.

“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

“Repeat, “You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:—

“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
    “And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”

“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
    “I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.”

“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?”

“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    “I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?”

“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”

“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.”

“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?”

“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”

“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.

“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the words have got altered.”

“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

“What size do you want to be?” it asked.

“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”

“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.

“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”

“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!”

“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.”

“One side of what? The other side of what?” thought Alice to herself.

“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *
“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.

“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”

“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”

“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.

“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”

“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.

“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”

“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”

“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”

“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.

“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”

“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”

“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”

“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want yours: I don’t like them raw.”

“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.

CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.

“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”

“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.

“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.

“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first question, you know.”

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!”

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”

“But what am I to do?” said Alice.

“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.

“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”

“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—

“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could grin.”

“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”

“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”

“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”

“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I—”

“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:

“Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.”

CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):

“Wow! wow! wow!”

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—

“I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!”

CHORUS.

“Wow! wow! wow!”

“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.”

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.

No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.

“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.

“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.

“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort of people live about here?”

“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”

“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.

“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”

“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.

“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”

Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know that you’re mad?”

“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”

“I suppose so,” said Alice.

“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”

“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.

“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?”

“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”

“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”

“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.

“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.

“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”

“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”

CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.

“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.

“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.

“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.

“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.”

“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.”

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”

“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.

“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March Hare.

“Exactly so,” said Alice.

“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.

“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.”

“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”

“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”

“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”

“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”

“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.

“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the best butter, you know.”

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t tell what o’clock it is!”

“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does your watch tell you what year it is?”

“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.”

“Which is just the case with mine,” said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.

“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”

“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.

“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”

“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.

“Nor I,” said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”

“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.”

“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.

“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”

“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.”

“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”

(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”

“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.”

“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’

You know the song, perhaps?”

“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.

“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—

‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.

“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!’”

“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.

“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”

A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?” she asked.

“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”

“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.

“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”

“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured to ask.

“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning. “I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”

“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.

“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”

“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.

“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.

“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again before it’s done.”

“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—”

“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.

“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.

“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked; “they’d have been ill.”

“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.”

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But why did they live at the bottom of a well?”

“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t take more.”

“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to take more than nothing.”

“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.

“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, “It was a treacle-well.”

“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.”

“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I dare say there may be one.”

“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you know—”

“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place on.”

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?”

“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”

“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.

“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.

“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—”

“Why with an M?” said Alice.

“Why not?” said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”

“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”

“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.

CHAPTER VIII.
The Queen’s Croquet-Ground
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”

“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”

On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!”

“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”

“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.

“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.

“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”

“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”

“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.

“How should I know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no business of mine.”

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”

“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is only a child!”

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn them over!”

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.

“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What have you been doing here?”

“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”

“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.

“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.

“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in reply.

“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.

“Yes!” shouted Alice.

“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”

“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under sentence of execution.”

“What for?” said Alice.

“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.

“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for?’”

“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—”

“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!”

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”

“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”

“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.

“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”

The Queen smiled and passed on.

“Who are you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.

“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to introduce it.”

“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.”

“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.

“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.

“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.”

“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!”

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.

“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.

The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.

The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.

The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.”

“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.

CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtle’s Story
“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.

“When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”

“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.

“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.

“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.

“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”

“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”

“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”

“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.

“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”

“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.

“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”

“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.

“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”

“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.

“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”

“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”

“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”

“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”

“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.

“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.

“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”

“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.

“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.

“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.

“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”

But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!”

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”

“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”

“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.

“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.

“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, that’s a good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

“What is the fun?” said Alice.

“Why, she,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!”

“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.

“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.”

“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she waited patiently.

“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.

“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”

“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.

“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull!”

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!” and he went on in these words:

“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”

“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.

“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.

“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.

“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”

“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so proud as all that.”

“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”

“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.

“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.

“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. “Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, ‘French, music, and washing—extra.’”

“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom of the sea.”

“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I only took the regular course.”

“What was that?” inquired Alice.

“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”

“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”

“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”

“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.”

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”

“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”

“What was that like?” said Alice.

“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”

“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.”

“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”

“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.

“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.

“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”

“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.

“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?”

“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.

“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.

“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”

CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:—

“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—” (Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”

“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”

“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore—”

“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”

“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.

“—you advance twice—”

“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.

“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”

“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.

“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”

“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

“—as far out to sea as you can—”

“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.

“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.

“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.

“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.

“Very much indeed,” said Alice.

“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”

“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—

“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”

“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!”

“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them, of course?”

“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself hastily.

“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”

“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”

“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.

“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”

“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.”

“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you know why it’s called a whiting?”

“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”

“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated in a wondering tone.

“Why, what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what makes them so shiny?”

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”

“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”

“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”

“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want you with us!’”

“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”

“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”

“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.

“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.”

“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.”

“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.

“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”

“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.

“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the sluggard,’” said the Gryphon.

“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—

“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”

“That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,” said the Gryphon.

“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds uncommon nonsense.”

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.

“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next verse.”

“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How could he turn them out with his nose, you know?”

“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘I passed by his garden.’”

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—

“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”

“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!”

“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.

“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”

“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,’ will you, old fellow?”

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:—

“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”

“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the distance.

“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.

“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—

“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”

CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.”

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”

“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”

“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—

“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!”

“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.

“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before that!”

“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”

“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said.

“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.

“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.

“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.

“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.

“Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.

“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.”

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.

“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.”

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.

“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”

“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”

“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse.

“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing too.”

“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”

“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”

“The twinkling of the what?” said the King.

“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.

“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!”

“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”

“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

“You did!” said the Hatter.

“I deny it!” said the March Hare.

“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”

“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”

“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.

“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.

“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.

“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)

“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”

“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the King.

“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”

“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get on better.”

“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.

“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.

“Call the next witness!” said the King.

The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

“Give your evidence,” said the King.

“Shan’t,” said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”

“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”

“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.

“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.

“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!”

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.

“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven’t got much evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name “Alice!”

CHAPTER XII.
Alice’s Evidence
“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.”

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.

“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.

“Nothing,” said Alice.

“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.

“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.

“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,” he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,

“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.” Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.”

Everybody looked at Alice.

“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.

“You are,” said the King.

“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.

“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.”

“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.

“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked up.”

“What’s in it?” said the Queen.

“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”

“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”

“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.

“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”

“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.

“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)

“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)

“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”

“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.”

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.

“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.

“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!”

“Read them,” said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?” he asked.

“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”

“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”

“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.”

The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper.

“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)

“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: “‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know—”

“But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you,’” said Alice.

“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—‘before she had this fit—’ you never had fits, my dear, I think?” he said to the Queen.

“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”

“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence first!”

“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.

“I won’t!” said Alice.

“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.

“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!”

“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.” So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days."

THERE IS NO ONE LEFT
When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.

One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.

“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.”

The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.

There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.

“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.

She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer’s face.

“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.

“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice. “Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.”

The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.

“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool I was!”

At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder. “What is it? What is it?” Mrs. Lennox gasped.

“Someone has died,” answered the boy officer. “You did not say it had broken out among your servants.”

“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried. “Come with me! Come with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.

After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.

During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.

Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.

When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely someone would remember and come to look for her.

But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.

“How queer and quiet it is,” she said. “It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”

Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.

“What desolation!” she heard one voice say. “That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.”

Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.

“Barney!” he cried out. “There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”

“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow “A place like this!” “I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?”

“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to his companions. “She has actually been forgotten!”

“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot. “Why does nobody come?”

The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.

“Poor little kid!” he said. “There is nobody left to come.”

It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.





CHAPTER II
MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY
Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done.

She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman’s house where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious.

It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him. She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.

“Why don’t you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?” he said. “There in the middle,” and he leaned over her to point.

“Go away!” cried Mary. “I don’t want boys. Go away!”

For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was always teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.

“Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
    How does your garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells,
    And marigolds all in a row.”
He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary, quite contrary”; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.

“You are going to be sent home,” Basil said to her, “at the end of the week. And we’re glad of it.”

“I am glad of it, too,” answered Mary. “Where is home?”

“She doesn’t know where home is!” said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn. “It’s England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You have none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.”

“I don’t know anything about him,” snapped Mary.

“I know you don’t,” Basil answered. “You don’t know anything. Girls never do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him. He’s so cross he won’t let them, and they wouldn’t come if he would let them. He’s a hunchback, and he’s horrid.”

“I don’t believe you,” said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.

But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.

“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward. “And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child. The children call her ‘Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,’ and though it’s naughty of them, one can’t help understanding it.”

“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.”

“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,” sighed Mrs. Crawford. “When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.”

Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer’s wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.

“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said. “And we’d heard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn’t handed much of it down, has she, ma’am?”

“Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,” the officer’s wife said good-naturedly. “If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her features are rather good. Children alter so much.”

“She’ll have to alter a good deal,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “And, there’s nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask me!”

They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.

Since she had been living in other people’s houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone’s little girl. She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself.

She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her. It would have made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl.

But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts. She was the kind of woman who would “stand no nonsense from young ones.” At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s daughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. She never dared even to ask a question.

“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,” Mr. Craven had said in his short, cold way. “Captain Lennox was my wife’s brother and I am their daughter’s guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must go to London and bring her yourself.”

So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.

Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crêpe hat.

“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,” Mrs. Medlock thought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.

“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,” she said. “Do you know anything about your uncle?”

“No,” said Mary.

“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”

“No,” said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular. Certainly they had never told her things.

“Humph,” muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive little face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again.

“I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you. You are going to a queer place.”

Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.

“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven’s proud of it in his way—and that’s gloomy enough, too. The house is six hundred years old and it’s on the edge of the moor, and there’s near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them’s shut up and locked. And there’s pictures and fine old furniture and things that’s been there for ages, and there’s a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground—some of them.” She paused and took another breath. “But there’s nothing else,” she ended suddenly.

Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend to look as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways. So she sat still.

“Well,” said Mrs. Medlock. “What do you think of it?”

“Nothing,” she answered. “I know nothing about such places.”

That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.

“Eh!” she said, “but you are like an old woman. Don’t you care?”

“It doesn’t matter” said Mary, “whether I care or not.”

“You are right enough there,” said Mrs. Medlock. “It doesn’t. What you’re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don’t know, unless because it’s the easiest way. He’s not going to trouble himself about you, that’s sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.”

She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.

“He’s got a crooked back,” she said. “That set him wrong. He was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married.”

Mary’s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care. She had never thought of the hunchback’s being married and she was a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate.

“She was a sweet, pretty thing and he’d have walked the world over to get her a blade o’ grass she wanted. Nobody thought she’d marry him, but she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she didn’t—she didn’t,” positively. “When she died—”

Mary gave a little involuntary jump.

“Oh! did she die!” she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called “Riquet à la Houppe.” It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.

“Yes, she died,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “And it made him queerer than ever. He cares about nobody. He won’t see people. Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and won’t let anyone but Pitcher see him. Pitcher’s an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways.”

It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moor was—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also! She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks “full of lace.” But she was not there any more.

“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you won’t,” said Mrs. Medlock. “And you mustn’t expect that there will be people to talk to you. You’ll have to play about and look after yourself. You’ll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you’re to keep out of. There’s gardens enough. But when you’re in the house don’t go wandering and poking about. Mr. Craven won’t have it.”

“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little Mary and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him.

And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.





CHAPTER III
ACROSS THE MOOR
She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.

“You have had a sleep!” she said. “It’s time to open your eyes! We’re at Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long drive before us.”

Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.

The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.

“I see tha’s got back,” he said. “An’ tha’s browt th’ young ’un with thee.”

“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary. “How’s thy Missus?”

“Well enow. Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”

A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.

When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the edge of a moor.

“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.

“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,” the woman answered. “We’ve got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor. You won’t see much because it’s a dark night, but you can see something.”

Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set out for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or at least it seemed a long time to her.

At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.

“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock.

The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.

“It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary, looking round at her companion.

“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “Nor it isn’t fields nor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.”

“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said Mary. “It sounds like the sea just now.”

“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock said. “It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there’s plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather’s in bloom.”

On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.

“I don’t like it,” she said to herself. “I don’t like it,” and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.

The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief.

“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,” she exclaimed. “It’s the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events.”

It was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.

They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.

The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.

A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.

“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice. “He doesn’t want to see her. He’s going to London in the morning.”

“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “So long as I know what’s expected of me, I can manage.”

“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said, “is that you make sure that he’s not disturbed and that he doesn’t see what he doesn’t want to see.”

And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.

Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:

“Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you’ll live—and you must keep to them. Don’t you forget that!”

It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.





CHAPTER IV
MARTHA
When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.

“What is that?” she said, pointing out of the window.

Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.

“That there?” she said.

“Yes.”

“That’s th’ moor,” with a good-natured grin. “Does tha’ like it?”

“No,” answered Mary. “I hate it.”

“That’s because tha’rt not used to it,” Martha said, going back to her hearth. “Tha’ thinks it’s too big an’ bare now. But tha’ will like it.”

“Do you?” inquired Mary.

“Aye, that I do,” answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate. “I just love it. It’s none bare. It’s covered wi’ growin’ things as smells sweet. It’s fair lovely in spring an’ summer when th’ gorse an’ broom an’ heather’s in flower. It smells o’ honey an’ there’s such a lot o’ fresh air—an’ th’ sky looks so high an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin’ an’ singin’. Eh! I wouldn’t live away from th’ moor for anythin’.”

Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them “protector of the poor” and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say “please” and “thank you” and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped her was only a little girl.

“You are a strange servant,” she said from her pillows, rather haughtily.

Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.

“Eh! I know that,” she said. “If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th’ under housemaids. I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I’d never have been let upstairs. I’m too common an’ I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is a funny house for all it’s so grand. Seems like there’s neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an’ Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won’t be troubled about anythin’ when he’s here, an’ he’s nearly always away. Mrs. Medlock gave me th’ place out o’ kindness. She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.”

“Are you going to be my servant?” Mary asked, still in her imperious little Indian way.

Martha began to rub her grate again.

“I’m Mrs. Medlock’s servant,” she said stoutly. “An’ she’s Mr. Craven’s—but I’m to do the housemaid’s work up here an’ wait on you a bit. But you won’t need much waitin’ on.”

“Who is going to dress me?” demanded Mary.

Martha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broad Yorkshire in her amazement.

“Canna’ tha’ dress thysen!” she said.

“What do you mean? I don’t understand your language,” said Mary.

“Eh! I forgot,” Martha said. “Mrs. Medlock told me I’d have to be careful or you wouldn’t know what I was sayin’. I mean can’t you put on your own clothes?”

“No,” answered Mary, quite indignantly. “I never did in my life. My Ayah dressed me, of course.”

“Well,” said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent, “it’s time tha’ should learn. Tha’ cannot begin younger. It’ll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she couldn’t see why grand people’s children didn’t turn out fair fools—what with nurses an’ bein’ washed an’ dressed an’ took out to walk as if they was puppies!”

“It is different in India,” said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She could scarcely stand this.

But Martha was not at all crushed.

“Eh! I can see it’s different,” she answered almost sympathetically. “I dare say it’s because there’s such a lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people. When I heard you was comin’ from India I thought you was a black too.”

Mary sat up in bed furious.

“What!” she said. “What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughter of a pig!”

Martha stared and looked hot.

“Who are you callin’ names?” she said. “You needn’t be so vexed. That’s not th’ way for a young lady to talk. I’ve nothin’ against th’ blacks. When you read about ’em in tracts they’re always very religious. You always read as a black’s a man an’ a brother. I’ve never seen a black an’ I was fair pleased to think I was goin’ to see one close. When I come in to light your fire this mornin’ I crep’ up to your bed an’ pulled th’ cover back careful to look at you. An’ there you was,” disappointedly, “no more black than me—for all you’re so yeller.”

Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.

“You thought I was a native! You dared! You don’t know anything about natives! They are not people—they’re servants who must salaam to you. You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!”

She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl’s simple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing. She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent over her.

“Eh! you mustn’t cry like that there!” she begged. “You mustn’t for sure. I didn’t know you’d be vexed. I don’t know anythin’ about anythin’—just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin’.”

There was something comforting and really friendly in her queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. She gradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.

“It’s time for thee to get up now,” she said. “Mrs. Medlock said I was to carry tha’ breakfast an’ tea an’ dinner into th’ room next to this. It’s been made into a nursery for thee. I’ll help thee on with thy clothes if tha’ll get out o’ bed. If th’ buttons are at th’ back tha’ cannot button them up tha’self.”

When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night before with Mrs. Medlock.

“Those are not mine,” she said. “Mine are black.”

She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:

“Those are nicer than mine.”

“These are th’ ones tha’ must put on,” Martha answered. “Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get ’em in London. He said ‘I won’t have a child dressed in black wanderin’ about like a lost soul,’ he said. ‘It’d make the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.’ Mother she said she knew what he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She doesn’t hold with black hersel’.”

“I hate black things,” said Mary.

The dressing process was one which taught them both something. Martha had “buttoned up” her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.

“Why doesn’t tha’ put on tha’ own shoes?” she said when Mary quietly held out her foot.

“My Ayah did it,” answered Mary, staring. “It was the custom.”

She said that very often—“It was the custom.” The native servants were always saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, “It is not the custom” and one knew that was the end of the matter.

It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady’s maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.

If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at Martha’s readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first she was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.

“Eh! you should see ’em all,” she said. “There’s twelve of us an’ my father only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother’s put to it to get porridge for ’em all. They tumble about on th’ moor an’ play there all day an’ mother says th’ air of th’ moor fattens ’em. She says she believes they eat th’ grass same as th’ wild ponies do. Our Dickon, he’s twelve years old and he’s got a young pony he calls his own.”

“Where did he get it?” asked Mary.

“He found it on th’ moor with its mother when it was a little one an’ he began to make friends with it an’ give it bits o’ bread an’ pluck young grass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an’ it lets him get on its back. Dickon’s a kind lad an’ animals likes him.”

Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she had never before been interested in anyone but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in. It was not a child’s room, but a grown-up person’s room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her.

“I don’t want it,” she said.

“Tha’ doesn’t want thy porridge!” Martha exclaimed incredulously.

“No.”

“Tha’ doesn’t know how good it is. Put a bit o’ treacle on it or a bit o’ sugar.”

“I don’t want it,” repeated Mary.

“Eh!” said Martha. “I can’t abide to see good victuals go to waste. If our children was at this table they’d clean it bare in five minutes.”

“Why?” said Mary coldly.

“Why!” echoed Martha. “Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives. They’re as hungry as young hawks an’ foxes.”

“I don’t know what it is to be hungry,” said Mary, with the indifference of ignorance.

Martha looked indignant.

“Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,” she said outspokenly. “I’ve no patience with folk as sits an’ just stares at good bread an’ meat. My word! don’t I wish Dickon and Phil an’ Jane an’ th’ rest of ’em had what’s here under their pinafores.”

“Why don’t you take it to them?” suggested Mary.

“It’s not mine,” answered Martha stoutly. “An’ this isn’t my day out. I get my day out once a month same as th’ rest. Then I go home an’ clean up for mother an’ give her a day’s rest.”

Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.

“You wrap up warm an’ run out an’ play you,” said Martha. “It’ll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat.”

Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.

“Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?”

“Well, if tha’ doesn’t go out tha’lt have to stay in, an’ what has tha’ got to do?”

Mary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like.

“Who will go with me?” she inquired.

Martha stared.

“You’ll go by yourself,” she answered. “You’ll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven’t got sisters and brothers. Our Dickon goes off on th’ moor by himself an’ plays for hours. That’s how he made friends with th’ pony. He’s got sheep on th’ moor that knows him, an’ birds as comes an’ eats out of his hand. However little there is to eat, he always saves a bit o’ his bread to coax his pets.”

It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though she was not aware of it. There would be, birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.

Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way downstairs.

“If tha’ goes round that way tha’ll come to th’ gardens,” she said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. “There’s lots o’ flowers in summer-time, but there’s nothin’ bloomin’ now.” She seemed to hesitate a second before she added, “One of th’ gardens is locked up. No one has been in it for ten years.”

“Why?” asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.

“Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won’t let no one go inside. It was her garden. He locked th’ door an’ dug a hole and buried th’ key. There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell ringing—I must run.”

After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not the garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You could always walk into a garden.

She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it. She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing. She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.

She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.

Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw Mary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her “quite contrary” expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him.

“What is this place?” she asked.

“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered.

“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door.

“Another of ’em,” shortly. “There’s another on t’other side o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that.”

“Can I go in them?” asked Mary.

“If tha’ likes. But there’s nowt to see.”

Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the second green door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be seen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.

She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though she was “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it.

Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered if she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not like him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing.

“People never like me and I never like people,” she thought. “And I never can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talking and laughing and making noises.”

She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path.

“I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,” she said. “There was a wall round the place and there was no door.”

She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found the old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watched him a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him.

“I have been into the other gardens,” she said.

“There was nothin’ to prevent thee,” he answered crustily.

“I went into the orchard.”

“There was no dog at th’ door to bite thee,” he answered.

“There was no door there into the other garden,” said Mary.

“What garden?” he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a moment.

“The one on the other side of the wall,” answered Mistress Mary. “There are trees there—I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang.”

To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its expression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.

He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle—a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.

Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a soft little rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener’s foot.

“Here he is,” chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child.

“Where has tha’ been, tha’ cheeky little beggar?” he said. “I’ve not seen thee before today. Has tha begun tha’ courtin’ this early in th’ season? Tha’rt too forrad.”

The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.

“Will he always come when you call him?” she asked almost in a whisper.

“Aye, that he will. I’ve knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. He come out of th’ nest in th’ other garden an’ when first he flew over th’ wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an’ we got friendly. When he went over th’ wall again th’ rest of th’ brood was gone an’ he was lonely an’ he come back to me.”

“What kind of a bird is he?” Mary asked.

“Doesn’t tha’ know? He’s a robin redbreast an’ they’re th’ friendliest, curiousest birds alive. They’re almost as friendly as dogs—if you know how to get on with ’em. Watch him peckin’ about there an’ lookin’ round at us now an’ again. He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”

It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him.

“He’s a conceited one,” he chuckled. “He likes to hear folk talk about him. An’ curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an’ meddlin’. He’s always comin’ to see what I’m plantin’. He knows all th’ things Mester Craven never troubles hissel’ to find out. He’s th’ head gardener, he is.”

The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out all about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.

“Where did the rest of the brood fly to?” she asked.

“There’s no knowin’. The old ones turn ’em out o’ their nest an’ make ’em fly an’ they’re scattered before you know it. This one was a knowin’ one an’ he knew he was lonely.”

Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard.

“I’m lonely,” she said.

She had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin.

The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute.

“Art tha’ th’ little wench from India?” he asked.

Mary nodded.

“Then no wonder tha’rt lonely. Tha’lt be lonlier before tha’s done,” he said.

He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.

“What is your name?” Mary inquired.

He stood up to answer her.

“Ben Weatherstaff,” he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle, “I’m lonely mysel’ except when he’s with me,” and he jerked his thumb toward the robin. “He’s th’ only friend I’ve got.”

“I have no friends at all,” said Mary. “I never had. My Ayah didn’t like me and I never played with anyone.”

It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.

“Tha’ an’ me are a good bit alike,” he said. “We was wove out of th’ same cloth. We’re neither of us good lookin’ an’ we’re both of us as sour as we look. We’ve got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I’ll warrant.”

This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also if she was “nasty tempered.” She felt uncomfortable.

Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.

“What did he do that for?” asked Mary.

“He’s made up his mind to make friends with thee,” replied Ben. “Dang me if he hasn’t took a fancy to thee.”

“To me?” said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up.

“Would you make friends with me?” she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person. “Would you?” And she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle.

“Why,” he cried out, “tha’ said that as nice an’ human as if tha’ was a real child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha’ said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th’ moor.”

“Do you know Dickon?” Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.

“Everybody knows him. Dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere. Th’ very blackberries an’ heather-bells knows him. I warrant th’ foxes shows him where their cubs lies an’ th’ skylarks doesn’t hide their nests from him.”

Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost as curious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just that moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had other things to do.

“He has flown over the wall!” Mary cried out, watching him. “He has flown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into the garden where there is no door!”

“He lives there,” said old Ben. “He came out o’ th’ egg there. If he’s courtin’, he’s makin’ up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th’ old rose-trees there.”

“Rose-trees,” said Mary. “Are there rose-trees?”

Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.

“There was ten year’ ago,” he mumbled.

“I should like to see them,” said Mary. “Where is the green door? There must be a door somewhere.”

Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him.

“There was ten year’ ago, but there isn’t now,” he said.

“No door!” cried Mary. “There must be.”

“None as anyone can find, an’ none as is anyone’s business. Don’t you be a meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where it’s no cause to go. Here, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an’ play you. I’ve no more time.”

And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.





CHAPTER V
THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR
At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out. She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.

But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty.

“Tha’ got on well enough with that this mornin’, didn’t tha’?” said Martha.

“It tastes nice today,” said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.

“It’s th’ air of th’ moor that’s givin’ thee stomach for tha’ victuals,” answered Martha. “It’s lucky for thee that tha’s got victuals as well as appetite. There’s been twelve in our cottage as had th’ stomach an’ nothin’ to put in it. You go on playin’ you out o’ doors every day an’ you’ll get some flesh on your bones an’ you won’t be so yeller.”

“I don’t play,” said Mary. “I have nothing to play with.”

“Nothin’ to play with!” exclaimed Martha. “Our children plays with sticks and stones. They just runs about an’ shouts an’ looks at things.” Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.

One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.

A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff’s robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side.

“Oh!” she cried out, “is it you—is it you?” And it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would understand and answer her.

He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was as if he said:

“Good morning! Isn’t the wind nice? Isn’t the sun nice? Isn’t everything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come on!”

Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—she actually looked almost pretty for a moment.

“I like you! I like you!” she cried out, pattering down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.

That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard. Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside.

“It’s in the garden no one can go into,” she said to herself. “It’s the garden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what it is like!”

She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning. Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.

“It is the garden,” she said. “I am sure it is.”

She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she only found what she had found before—that there was no door in it. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door.

“It’s very queer,” she said. “Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key.”

This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.

She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not feel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire.

“Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?” she said.

She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all. She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants’ hall downstairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by “blacks,” was novelty enough to attract her.

She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.

“Art tha’ thinkin’ about that garden yet?” she said. “I knew tha’ would. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.”

“Why did he hate it?” Mary persisted.

Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.

“Listen to th’ wind wutherin’ round the house,” she said. “You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight.”

Mary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened, and then she understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in. But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.

“But why did he hate it so?” she asked, after she had listened. She intended to know if Martha did.

Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.

“Mind,” she said, “Mrs. Medlock said it’s not to be talked about. There’s lots o’ things in this place that’s not to be talked over. That’s Mr. Craven’s orders. His troubles are none servants’ business, he says. But for th’ garden he wouldn’t be like he is. It was Mrs. Craven’s garden that she had made when first they were married an’ she just loved it, an’ they used to ’tend the flowers themselves. An’ none o’ th’ gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an’ her used to go in an’ shut th’ door an’ stay there hours an’ hours, readin’ and talkin’. An’ she was just a bit of a girl an’ there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it. An’ she made roses grow over it an’ she used to sit there. But one day when she was sittin’ there th’ branch broke an’ she fell on th’ ground an’ was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th’ doctors thought he’d go out o’ his mind an’ die, too. That’s why he hates it. No one’s never gone in since, an’ he won’t let anyone talk about it.”

Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and listened to the wind “wutherin’.” It seemed to be “wutherin’” louder than ever.

At that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things had happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. She had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had found out what it was to be sorry for someone.

But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away, but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.

“Do you hear anyone crying?” she said.

Martha suddenly looked confused.

“No,” she answered. “It’s th’ wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if someone was lost on th’ moor an’ wailin’. It’s got all sorts o’ sounds.”

“But listen,” said Mary. “It’s in the house—down one of those long corridors.”

And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever.

“There!” said Mary. “I told you so! It is someone crying—and it isn’t a grown-up person.”

Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased “wutherin’” for a few moments.

“It was th’ wind,” said Martha stubbornly. “An’ if it wasn’t, it was little Betty Butterworth, th’ scullery-maid. She’s had th’ toothache all day.”

But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary stare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.





CHAPTER VI
“THERE WAS SOMEONE CRYING—THERE WAS!”
The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud. There could be no going out today.

“What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?” she asked Martha.

“Try to keep from under each other’s feet mostly,” Martha answered. “Eh! there does seem a lot of us then. Mother’s a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th’ cow-shed and plays there. Dickon he doesn’t mind th’ wet. He goes out just th’ same as if th’ sun was shinin’. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn’t show when it’s fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th’ bosom of his shirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an’ th’ hole was swum out an’ th’ rest o’ th’ litter was dead. He’s got it at home now. He found a half-drowned young crow another time an’ he brought it home, too, an’ tamed it. It’s named Soot because it’s so black, an’ it hops an’ flies about with him everywhere.”

The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha’s familiar talk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Martha told stories of what “mother” said or did they always sounded comfortable.

“If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,” said Mary. “But I have nothing.”

Martha looked perplexed.

“Can tha’ knit?” she asked.

“No,” answered Mary.

“Can tha’ sew?”

“No.”

“Can tha’ read?”

“Yes.”

“Then why doesn’t tha read somethin’, or learn a bit o’ spellin’? Tha’st old enough to be learnin’ thy book a good bit now.”

“I haven’t any books,” said Mary. “Those I had were left in India.”

“That’s a pity,” said Martha. “If Mrs. Medlock’d let thee go into th’ library, there’s thousands o’ books there.”

Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself. She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper’s sitting-room downstairs. In this queer place one scarcely ever saw anyone at all. In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants’ hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.

Mary’s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children. In India she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She had often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on.

“Hasn’t tha’ got good sense?” she said once, when Mary had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her. “Our Susan Ann is twice as sharp as thee an’ she’s only four year’ old. Sometimes tha’ looks fair soft in th’ head.”

Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things.

She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them. Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn’t she go and see how many doors she could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her.

She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house. Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks. She always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.

“Where do you live now?” said Mary aloud to her. “I wish you were here.”

Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true.

It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.

“Perhaps she slept here once,” said Mary. “She stares at me so that she makes me feel queer.”

After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.

In one room, which looked like a lady’s sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.

In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound. It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.

Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.

“If they wouldn’t be so frightened I would take them back with me,” said Mary.

She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor again, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was.

“I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,” she said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall. “I don’t know which way to go. How still everything is!”

It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.

“It’s nearer than it was,” said Mary, her heart beating rather faster. “And it is crying.”

She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then sprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.

“What are you doing here?” she said, and she took Mary by the arm and pulled her away. “What did I tell you?”

“I turned round the wrong corner,” explained Mary. “I didn’t know which way to go and I heard someone crying.” She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more the next.

“You didn’t hear anything of the sort,” said the housekeeper. “You come along back to your own nursery or I’ll box your ears.”

And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room.

“Now,” she said, “you stay where you’re told to stay or you’ll find yourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as he said he would. You’re one that needs someone to look sharp after you. I’ve got enough to do.”

She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground her teeth.

“There was someone crying—there was—there was!” she said to herself.

She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had found out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.





CHAPTER VII
THE KEY TO THE GARDEN
Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.

“Look at the moor! Look at the moor!”

The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.

“Aye,” said Martha with a cheerful grin. “Th’ storm’s over for a bit. It does like this at this time o’ th’ year. It goes off in a night like it was pretendin’ it had never been here an’ never meant to come again. That’s because th’ springtime’s on its way. It’s a long way off yet, but it’s comin’.”

“I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,” Mary said.

“Eh! no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes. “Nowt o’ th’ soart!”

“What does that mean?” asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not surprised when Martha used words she did not know.

Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.

“There now,” she said. “I’ve talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn’t. ‘Nowt o’ th’ soart’ means ‘nothin’-of-the-sort,’” slowly and carefully, “but it takes so long to say it. Yorkshire’s th’ sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I told thee tha’d like th’ moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see th’ gold-colored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom, an’ th’ heather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’ hundreds o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’ skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’. You’ll want to get out on it at sunrise an’ live out on it all day like Dickon does.”

“Could I ever get there?” asked Mary wistfully, looking through her window at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.

“I don’t know,” answered Martha. “Tha’s never used tha’ legs since tha’ was born, it seems to me. Tha’ couldn’t walk five mile. It’s five mile to our cottage.”

“I should like to see your cottage.”

Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann’s when she wanted something very much.

“I’ll ask my mother about it,” she said. “She’s one o’ them that nearly always sees a way to do things. It’s my day out today an’ I’m goin’ home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o’ mother. Perhaps she could talk to her.”

“I like your mother,” said Mary.

“I should think tha’ did,” agreed Martha, polishing away.

“I’ve never seen her,” said Mary.

“No, tha’ hasn’t,” replied Martha.

She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite positively.

“Well, she’s that sensible an’ hard workin’ an’ good-natured an’ clean that no one could help likin’ her whether they’d seen her or not. When I’m goin’ home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I’m crossin’ the moor.”

“I like Dickon,” added Mary. “And I’ve never seen him.”

“Well,” said Martha stoutly, “I’ve told thee that th’ very birds likes him an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep an’ ponies, an’ th’ foxes themselves. I wonder,” staring at her reflectively, “what Dickon would think of thee?”

“He wouldn’t like me,” said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. “No one does.”

Martha looked reflective again.

“How does tha’ like thysel’?” she inquired, really quite as if she were curious to know.

Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.

“Not at all—really,” she answered. “But I never thought of that before.”

Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.

“Mother said that to me once,” she said. “She was at her wash-tub an’ I was in a bad temper an’ talkin’ ill of folk, an’ she turns round on me an’ says: ‘Tha’ young vixen, tha’! There tha’ stands sayin’ tha’ doesn’t like this one an’ tha’ doesn’t like that one. How does tha’ like thysel’?’ It made me laugh an’ it brought me to my senses in a minute.”

She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week’s baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.

Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place look different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He spoke to her of his own accord.

“Springtime’s comin,’” he said. “Cannot tha’ smell it?”

Mary sniffed and thought she could.

“I smell something nice and fresh and damp,” she said.

“That’s th’ good rich earth,” he answered, digging away. “It’s in a good humor makin’ ready to grow things. It’s glad when plantin’ time comes. It’s dull in th’ winter when it’s got nowt to do. In th’ flower gardens out there things will be stirrin’ down below in th’ dark. Th’ sun’s warmin’ ’em. You’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’ out o’ th’ black earth after a bit.”

“What will they be?” asked Mary.

“Crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys. Has tha’ never seen them?”

“No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,” said Mary. “And I think things grow up in a night.”

“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff. “Tha’ll have to wait for ’em. They’ll poke up a bit higher here, an’ push out a spike more there, an’ uncurl a leaf this day an’ another that. You watch ’em.”

“I am going to,” answered Mary.

Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.

“Do you think he remembers me?” she said.

“Remembers thee!” said Weatherstaff indignantly. “He knows every cabbage stump in th’ gardens, let alone th’ people. He’s never seen a little wench here before, an’ he’s bent on findin’ out all about thee. Tha’s no need to try to hide anything from him.”

“Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives?” Mary inquired.

“What garden?” grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.

“The one where the old rose-trees are.” She could not help asking, because she wanted so much to know. “Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?”

“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the robin. “He’s the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it for ten year’.”

Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten years ago.

She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha’s mother. She was beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to like—when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one of the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff’s robin.

She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare flower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little.

“You do remember me!” she cried out. “You do! You are prettier than anything else in the world!”

She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail and twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.

Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it because he was a real person—only nicer than any other person in the world. She was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.

The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm. The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.

Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.

Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger.

“Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,” she said in a whisper. “Perhaps it is the key to the garden!”





CHAPTER VIII
THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY
She looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over, and thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who had been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. All she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it during ten years. Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The thought of that pleased her very much.

Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Already she felt less “contrary,” though she did not know why.

She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much disappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. She took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.

Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.

“I got up at four o’clock,” she said. “Eh! it was pretty on th’ moor with th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’ about an’ th’ sun risin’. I didn’t walk all th’ way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an’ I did enjoy myself.”

She was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother had been glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way. She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.

“I had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came in from playin’ on th’ moor. An’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice, clean hot bakin’ an’ there was a good fire, an’ they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king to live in.”

In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all her life by what Martha called “blacks” until she didn’t know how to put on her own stockings.

“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha. “They wanted to know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’ ship you came in. I couldn’t tell ’em enough.”

Mary reflected a little.

“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,” she said, “so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.”

“My word!” cried delighted Martha. “It would set ’em clean off their heads. Would tha’ really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once.”

“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly, as she thought the matter over. “I never thought of that. Did Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?”

“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head, they got that round,” answered Martha. “But mother, she was put out about your seemin’ to be all by yourself like. She said, ‘Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no governess for her, nor no nurse?’ and I said, ‘No, he hasn’t, though Mrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t think of it for two or three years.’”

“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply.

“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time an’ you ought to have a woman to look after you, an’ she says: ‘Now, Martha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin’ about all alone, an’ no mother. You do your best to cheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”

Mary gave her a long, steady look.

“You do cheer me up,” she said. “I like to hear you talk.”

Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her hands under her apron.

“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin. “I’ve brought thee a present.”

“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full of fourteen hungry people give anyone a present!

“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha explained. “An’ he stopped his cart at our door. He had pots an’ pans an’ odds an’ ends, but mother had no money to buy anythin’. Just as he was goin’ away our ’Lizabeth Ellen called out, ‘Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red an’ blue handles.’ An’ mother she calls out quite sudden, ‘Here, stop, mister! How much are they?’ An’ he says ‘Tuppence’, an’ mother she began fumblin’ in her pocket an’ she says to me, ‘Martha, tha’s brought me thy wages like a good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every penny, but I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’ here it is.”

She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly. It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed at it with a mystified expression.

“What is it for?” she asked curiously.

“For!” cried out Martha. “Does tha’ mean that they’ve not got skippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got elephants and tigers and camels! No wonder most of ’em’s black. This is what it’s for; just watch me.”

And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair to stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did not even see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary’s face delighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.

“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped. “I’ve skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn’t as fat then as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”

Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.

“It looks nice,” she said. “Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think I could ever skip like that?”

“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. “You can’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you’ll mount up. That’s what mother said. She says, ‘Nothin’ will do her more good than skippin’ rope. It’s th’ sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play out in th’ fresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’ give her some strength in ’em.’”

It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress Mary’s arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not very clever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.

“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’ doors,” said Martha. “Mother said I must tell you to keep out o’ doors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as tha’ wrap up warm.”

Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm. She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly.

“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages. It was your two-pence really. Thank you.” She said it stiffly because she was not used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her. “Thank you,” she said, and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do.

Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomed to this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.

“Eh! th’ art a queer, old-womanish thing,” she said. “If tha’d been our ’Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me a kiss.”

Mary looked stiffer than ever.

“Do you want me to kiss you?”

Martha laughed again.

“Nay, not me,” she answered. “If tha’ was different, p’raps tha’d want to thysel’. But tha’ isn’t. Run off outside an’ play with thy rope.”

Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room. Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not. The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more interested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered if he would notice her. She wanted him to see her skip.

“Well!” he exclaimed. “Upon my word. P’raps tha’ art a young ’un, after all, an’ p’raps tha’s got child’s blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk. Tha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s Ben Weatherstaff. I wouldn’t have believed tha’ could do it.”

“I never skipped before,” Mary said. “I’m just beginning. I can only go up to twenty.”

“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben. “Tha’ shapes well enough at it for a young ’un that’s lived with heathen. Just see how he’s watchin’ thee,” jerking his head toward the robin. “He followed after thee yesterday. He’ll be at it again today. He’ll be bound to find out what th’ skippin’-rope is. He’s never seen one. Eh!” shaking his head at the bird, “tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if tha’ doesn’t look sharp.”

Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robin she laughed again.

“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to show me the door today; but I don’t believe you know!”

The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off—and they are nearly always doing it.

Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah’s stories, and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.

One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did because she had seen something under it—a round knob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.

She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?

It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.

And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come, it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly.

Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.

She was standing inside the secret garden.





CHAPTER IX
THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANYONE EVER LIVED IN
It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.

“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”

Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.

“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”

She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.

“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”

If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.

But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through the door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her own.

The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another. He chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing her things. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from anyone, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!

Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to have been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.

As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green points. She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them.

“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses or snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.

She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth. She liked it very much.

“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,” she said. “I will go all over the garden and look.”

She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again.

“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to herself. “Even if the roses are dead, there are other things alive.”

She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow. She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them.

“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said, after she had finished with the first ones. “I am going to do ever so many more. I’ll do all I can see. If I haven’t time today I can come tomorrow.”

She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time.

The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see gardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben’s size and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once.

Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she had been working two or three hours. She had been actually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.

“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all round at her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard her.

Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.

“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’!” she said. “Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell her what th’ skippin’-rope’s done for thee.”

In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She had put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.

“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look like onions?”

“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha. “Lots o’ spring flowers grow from ’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’ crocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils and daffydowndillys. Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’ purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon’s got a whole lot of ’em planted in our bit o’ garden.”

“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea taking possession of her.

“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”

“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.

“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha. “That’s why poor folk can afford to have ’em. If you don’t trouble ’em, most of ’em’ll work away underground for a lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little ’uns. There’s a place in th’ park woods here where there’s snowdrops by thousands. They’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th’ spring comes. No one knows when they was first planted.”

“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary. “I want to see all the things that grow in England.”

She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth-rug.

“I wish—I wish I had a little spade,” she said.

“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha, laughing. “Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must tell mother that, too.”

Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if she meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear that.

“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she were turning matters over in her mind. “The house is lonely, and the park is lonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I never did many things in India, but there were more people to look at—natives and soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give me some seeds.”

Martha’s face quite lighted up.

“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of th’ things mother said. She says, ‘There’s such a lot o’ room in that big place, why don’t they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’ but parsley an’ radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’ be right down happy over it.’ Them was the very words she said.”

“Were they?” said Mary. “How many things she knows, doesn’t she?”

“Eh!” said Martha. “It’s like she says: ‘A woman as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C. Children’s as good as ’rithmetic to set you findin’ out things.’”

“How much would a spade cost—a little one?” Mary asked.

“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite village there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets with a spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for two shillings. An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”

“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary. “Mrs. Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.”

“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.

“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives me one every Saturday. I didn’t know what to spend it on.”

“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha. “Tha’ can buy anything in th’ world tha’ wants. Th’ rent of our cottage is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’ eye-teeth to get it. Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,” putting her hands on her hips.

“What?” said Mary eagerly.

“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’ flower-seeds for a penny each, and our Dickon he knows which is th’ prettiest ones an’ how to make ’em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th’ fun of it. Does tha’ know how to print letters?” suddenly.

“I know how to write,” Mary answered.

Martha shook her head.

“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we could write a letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’ garden tools an’ th’ seeds at th’ same time.”

“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried. “You are, really! I didn’t know you were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.”

“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha. “I bought ’em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I’ll go and get it.”

She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little hands together with sheer pleasure.

“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth nice and soft and dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden won’t be dead at all—it will come alive.”

She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay with her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that she could print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated to her:

“My Dear Dickon:

This comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present. Miss Mary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some flower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed. Pick the prettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before and lived in India which is different. Give my love to mother and everyone of you. Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my next day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen going hunting lions and tigers.

    “Your loving sister,
                “Martha Phœbe Sowerby.”
“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get th’ butcher boy to take it in his cart. He’s a great friend o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha.

“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”

“He’ll bring ’em to you himself. He’ll like to walk over this way.”

“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him! I never thought I should see Dickon.”

“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked so pleased.

“Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see him very much.”

Martha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.

“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me forgettin’ that there; an’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you first thing this mornin’. I asked mother—and she said she’d ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.”

“Do you mean—” Mary began.

“What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottage some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot oat cake, an’ butter, an’ a glass o’ milk.”

It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day. To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue! To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!

“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked, quite anxiously.

“Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is and how clean she keeps the cottage.”

“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,” said Mary, thinking it over and liking the idea very much. “She doesn’t seem to be like the mothers in India.”

Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But just before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.

“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the toothache again today?”

Martha certainly started slightly.

“What makes thee ask that?” she said.

“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard that far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn’t a wind today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”

“Eh!” said Martha restlessly. “Tha’ mustn’t go walkin’ about in corridors an’ listenin’. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there’s no knowin’ what he’d do.”

“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary. “I was just waiting for you—and I heard it. That’s three times.”

“My word! There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha, and she almost ran out of the room.

“It’s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,” said Mary drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her. Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably tired that she fell asleep.





CHAPTER X
DICKON
The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.

Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the “snowdrops by the thousands,” and about bulbs spreading and making new ones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.

During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.

“Tha’rt like th’ robin,” he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him. “I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha’ll come from.”

“He’s friends with me now,” said Mary.

“That’s like him,” snapped Ben Weatherstaff. “Makin’ up to th’ women folk just for vanity an’ flightiness. There’s nothin’ he wouldn’t do for th’ sake o’ showin’ off an’ flirtin’ his tail-feathers. He’s as full o’ pride as an egg’s full o’ meat.”

He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary’s questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual. He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over.

“How long has tha’ been here?” he jerked out.

“I think it’s about a month,” she answered.

“Tha’s beginnin’ to do Misselthwaite credit,” he said. “Tha’s a bit fatter than tha’ was an’ tha’s not quite so yeller. Tha’ looked like a young plucked crow when tha’ first came into this garden. Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young ’un.”

Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed.

“I know I’m fatter,” she said. “My stockings are getting tighter. They used to make wrinkles. There’s the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.”

There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever. His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But Ben was sarcastic.

“Aye, there tha’ art!” he said. “Tha’ can put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha’s got no one better. Tha’s been reddenin’ up thy waistcoat an’ polishin’ thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha’s up to. Tha’s courtin’ some bold young madam somewhere tellin’ thy lies to her about bein’ th’ finest cock robin on Missel Moor an’ ready to fight all th’ rest of ’em.”

“Oh! look at him!” exclaimed Mary.

The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him.

“Tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me by doin’ that,” said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look pleased. “Tha’ thinks no one can stand out against thee—that’s what tha’ thinks.”

The robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff’s spade and alighted on the top of it. Then the old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away. He spoke quite in a whisper.

“Well, I’m danged!” he said as softly as if he were saying something quite different. “Tha’ does know how to get at a chap—tha’ does! Tha’s fair unearthly, tha’s so knowin’.”

And he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.

But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid to talk to him.

“Have you a garden of your own?” she asked.

“No. I’m bachelder an’ lodge with Martin at th’ gate.”

“If you had one,” said Mary, “what would you plant?”

“Cabbages an’ ’taters an’ onions.”

“But if you wanted to make a flower garden,” persisted Mary, “what would you plant?”

“Bulbs an’ sweet-smellin’ things—but mostly roses.”

Mary’s face lighted up.

“Do you like roses?” she said.

Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.

“Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to. She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an’ she loved ’em like they was children—or robins. I’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss ’em.” He dragged out another weed and scowled at it. “That were as much as ten year’ ago.”

“Where is she now?” asked Mary, much interested.

“Heaven,” he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, “’cording to what parson says.”

“What happened to the roses?” Mary asked again, more interested than ever.

“They was left to themselves.”

Mary was becoming quite excited.

“Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?” she ventured.

“Well, I’d got to like ’em—an’ I liked her—an’ she liked ’em,” Ben Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly. “Once or twice a year I’d go an’ work at ’em a bit—prune ’em an’ dig about th’ roots. They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of ’em lived.”

“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?” inquired Mary.

“Wait till th’ spring gets at ’em—wait till th’ sun shines on th’ rain and th’ rain falls on th’ sunshine an’ then tha’ll find out.”

“How—how?” cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.

“Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an’ there, watch it after th’ warm rain an’ see what happens.” He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face. “Why does tha’ care so much about roses an’ such, all of a sudden?” he demanded.

Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.

“I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,” she stammered. “I—there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing—and no one.”

“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, “that’s true. Tha’ hasn’t.”

He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much. But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.

She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared. He answered everyone of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of.

“Do you go and see those other roses now?” she asked.

“Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th’ joints.”

He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see why he should.

“Now look here!” he said sharply. “Don’t tha’ ask so many questions. Tha’rt th’ worst wench for askin’ questions I’ve ever come across. Get thee gone an’ play thee. I’ve done talkin’ for today.”

And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to make him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers.

There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.

It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy about twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy’s face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make.

When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping.

“Don’t tha’ move,” he said. “It’d flight ’em.”

Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.

“I’m Dickon,” the boy said. “I know tha’rt Miss Mary.”

Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Dickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face.

“I got up slow,” he explained, “because if tha’ makes a quick move it startles ’em. A body ’as to move gentle an’ speak low when wild things is about.”

He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.

“Did you get Martha’s letter?” she asked.

He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.

“That’s why I come.”

He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped.

“I’ve got th’ garden tools. There’s a little spade an’ rake an’ a fork an’ hoe. Eh! they are good ’uns. There’s a trowel, too. An’ th’ woman in th’ shop threw in a packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when I bought th’ other seeds.”

“Will you show the seeds to me?” Mary said.

She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy. It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.

“Let us sit down on this log and look at them,” she said.

They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so many neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.

“There’s a lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies,” he said. “Mignonette’s th’ sweetest smellin’ thing as grows, an’ it’ll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will. Them as’ll come up an’ bloom if you just whistle to ’em, them’s th’ nicest of all.”

He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up.

“Where’s that robin as is callin’ us?” he said.

The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Mary thought she knew whose it was.

“Is it really calling us?” she asked.

“Aye,” said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, “he’s callin’ someone he’s friends with. That’s same as sayin’ ‘Here I am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.’ There he is in the bush. Whose is he?”

“He’s Ben Weatherstaff’s, but I think he knows me a little,” answered Mary.

“Aye, he knows thee,” said Dickon in his low voice again. “An’ he likes thee. He’s took thee on. He’ll tell me all about thee in a minute.”

He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin’s own twitter. The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he were replying to a question.

“Aye, he’s a friend o’ yours,” chuckled Dickon.

“Do you think he is?” cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. “Do you think he really likes me?”

“He wouldn’t come near thee if he didn’t,” answered Dickon. “Birds is rare choosers an’ a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he’s making up to thee now. ‘Cannot tha’ see a chap?’ he’s sayin’.”

And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush.

“Do you understand everything birds say?” said Mary.

Dickon’s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head.

“I think I do, and they think I do,” he said. “I’ve lived on th’ moor with ’em so long. I’ve watched ’em break shell an’ come out an’ fledge an’ learn to fly an’ begin to sing, till I think I’m one of ’em. Sometimes I think p’raps I’m a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an’ I don’t know it.”

He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers; he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.

“See here,” he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. “I’ll plant them for thee myself. Where is tha’ garden?”

Mary’s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went red and then pale.

“Tha’s got a bit o’ garden, hasn’t tha’?” Dickon said.

It was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do it, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.

“Wouldn’t they give thee a bit?” he asked. “Hasn’t tha’ got any yet?”

She held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him.

“I don’t know anything about boys,” she said slowly. “Could you keep a secret, if I told you one? It’s a great secret. I don’t know what I should do if anyone found it out. I believe I should die!” She said the last sentence quite fiercely.

Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.

“I’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time,” he said. “If I couldn’t keep secrets from th’ other lads, secrets about foxes’ cubs, an’ birds’ nests, an’ wild things’ holes, there’d be naught safe on th’ moor. Aye, I can keep secrets.”

Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it.

“I’ve stolen a garden,” she said very fast. “It isn’t mine. It isn’t anybody’s. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already. I don’t know.”

She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.

“I don’t care, I don’t care! Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don’t. They’re letting it die, all shut in by itself,” she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her face and burst out crying—poor little Mistress Mary.

Dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.

“Eh-h-h!” he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.

“I’ve nothing to do,” said Mary. “Nothing belongs to me. I found it myself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn’t take it from the robin.”

“Where is it?” asked Dickon in a dropped voice.

Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.

“Come with me and I’ll show you,” she said.

She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird’s nest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly.

“It’s this,” she said. “It’s a secret garden, and I’m the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.”

Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.

“Eh!” he almost whispered, “it is a queer, pretty place! It’s like as if a body was in a dream.”





CHAPTER XI
THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH
For two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched him, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four walls. His eyes seemed to be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.

“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last, in a whisper.

“Did you know about it?” asked Mary.

She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.

“We must talk low,” he said, “or someone’ll hear us an’ wonder what’s to do in here.”

“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth. “Did you know about the garden?” she asked again when she had recovered herself.

Dickon nodded.

“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,” he answered. “Us used to wonder what it was like.”

He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy.

“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said. “It’d be th’ safest nestin’ place in England. No one never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’ roses to build in. I wonder all th’ birds on th’ moor don’t build here.”

Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.

“Will there be roses?” she whispered. “Can you tell? I thought perhaps they were all dead.”

“Eh! No! Not them—not all of ’em!” he answered. “Look here!”

He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades.

“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he said. “An’ there’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some new last year. This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.

Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.

“That one?” she said. “Is that one quite alive quite?”

Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.

“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered that Martha had told her that “wick” meant “alive” or “lively.”

“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper. “I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are.”

She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was. They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.

“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest ones has fair thrived on it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th’ others has growed an’ growed, an’ spread an’ spread, till they’s a wonder. See here!” and he pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. “A body might think this was dead wood, but I don’t believe it is—down to th’ root. I’ll cut it low down an’ see.”

He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far above the earth.

“There!” he said exultantly. “I told thee so. There’s green in that wood yet. Look at it.”

Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.

“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that, it’s wick,” he explained. “When th’ inside is dry an’ breaks easy, like this here piece I’ve cut off, it’s done for. There’s a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, an’ if th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug round, and took care of there’ll be—” he stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—“there’ll be a fountain o’ roses here this summer.”

They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell too, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.

They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise.

“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. “Who did that there?”

It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points.

“I did it,” said Mary.

“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about gardenin’,” he exclaimed.

“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So I made a place for them. I don’t even know what they are.”

Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.

“Tha’ was right,” he said. “A gardener couldn’t have told thee better. They’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk. They’re crocuses an’ snowdrops, an’ these here is narcissuses,” turning to another patch, “an here’s daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.”

He ran from one clearing to another.

“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,” he said, looking her over.

“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing stronger. I used always to be tired. When I dig I’m not tired at all. I like to smell the earth when it’s turned up.”

“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his head wisely. “There’s naught as nice as th’ smell o’ good clean earth, except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’ things when th’ rain falls on ’em. I get out on th’ moor many a day when it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’ listen to th’ soft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an’ I just sniff an’ sniff. My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit’s, mother says.”

“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.

“Not me,” he said, grinning. “I never ketched cold since I was born. I wasn’t brought up nesh enough. I’ve chased about th’ moor in all weathers same as th’ rabbits does. Mother says I’ve sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year’ to ever get to sniffin’ with cold. I’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.”

He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him and helping him with her fork or the trowel.

“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once, looking about quite exultantly.

“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged. “I’m sure I can help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me. Oh! do come, Dickon!”

“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,” he answered stoutly. “It’s the best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an’ wakenin’ up a garden.”

“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me to make it alive I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she ended helplessly. What could you do for a boy like that?

“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his happy grin. “Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry as a young fox an’ tha’ll learn how to talk to th’ robin same as I do. Eh! we’ll have a lot o’ fun.”

He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.

“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s garden, all clipped an’ spick an’ span, would you?” he said. “It’s nicer like this with things runnin’ wild, an’ swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”

“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously. “It wouldn’t seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.”

Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.

“It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said, “but seems like someone besides th’ robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year’ ago.”

“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary. “No one could get in.”

“That’s true,” he answered. “It’s a queer place. Seems to me as if there’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here an’ there, later than ten year’ ago.”

“But how could it have been done?” said Mary.

He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.

“Aye! how could it!” he murmured. “With th’ door locked an’ th’ key buried.”

Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of course, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon began to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease her.

“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired.

“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away with the trowel, “an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’ campanulas.”

“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.

“There’s lilies o’ th, valley here already; I saw ’em. They’ll have growed too close an’ we’ll have to separate ’em, but there’s plenty. Th’ other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o’ plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha’ want ’em?”

Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India and of how she had hated them and of their calling her “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary.”

“They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—

‘Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
    How does your garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells,
    And marigolds all in a row.’
I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells.”

She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth.

“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”

But Dickon laughed.

“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it. “There doesn’t seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like, an’ such lots o’ friendly wild things runnin’ about makin’ homes for themselves, or buildin’ nests an’ singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”

Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped frowning.

“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said you were. I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five people.”

Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the grate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.

“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said. “Who is th’ other four?”

“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off on her fingers, “and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”

Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm over his mouth.

“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said, “but I think tha’ art th’ queerest little lass I ever saw.”

Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking anyone before. And she tried to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a native was always pleased if you knew his speech.

“Does tha’ like me?” she said.

“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an’ so does th’ robin, I do believe!”

“That’s two, then,” said Mary. “That’s two for me.”

And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner.

“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully. “And you will have to go too, won’t you?”

Dickon grinned.

“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said. “Mother always lets me put a bit o’ somethin’ in my pocket.”

He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.

“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but I’ve got a fine slice o’ fat bacon with it today.”

Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.

“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said. “I’ll be done with mine first. I’ll get some more work done before I start back home.”

He sat down with his back against a tree.

“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him th’ rind o’ th’ bacon to peck at. They likes a bit o’ fat wonderful.”

Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.

“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said.

His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.

“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest was, does tha’ think I’d tell anyone? Not me,” he said. “Tha’ art as safe as a missel thrush.”

And she was quite sure she was.





CHAPTER XII
“MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?”
Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room. Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near it.

“Tha’s a bit late,” she said. “Where has tha’ been?”

“I’ve seen Dickon!” said Mary. “I’ve seen Dickon!”

“I knew he’d come,” said Martha exultantly. “How does tha’ like him?”

“I think—I think he’s beautiful!” said Mary in a determined voice.

Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.

“Well,” she said, “he’s th’ best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.”

“I like it to turn up,” said Mary.

“An’ his eyes is so round,” said Martha, a trifle doubtful. “Though they’re a nice color.”

“I like them round,” said Mary. “And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor.”

Martha beamed with satisfaction.

“Mother says he made ’em that color with always lookin’ up at th’ birds an’ th’ clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn’t he, now?”

“I love his big mouth,” said Mary obstinately. “I wish mine were just like it.”

Martha chuckled delightedly.

“It’d look rare an’ funny in thy bit of a face,” she said. “But I knowed it would be that way when tha’ saw him. How did tha’ like th’ seeds an’ th’ garden tools?”

“How did you know he brought them?” asked Mary.

“Eh! I never thought of him not bringin’ ’em. He’d be sure to bring ’em if they was in Yorkshire. He’s such a trusty lad.”

Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but she did not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools, and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.

“Who did tha’ ask about it?” she inquired.

“I haven’t asked anybody yet,” said Mary, hesitating.

“Well, I wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener. He’s too grand, Mr. Roach is.”

“I’ve never seen him,” said Mary. “I’ve only seen undergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff.”

“If I was you, I’d ask Ben Weatherstaff,” advised Martha. “He’s not half as bad as he looks, for all he’s so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an’ he used to make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he’d find you a corner somewhere out o’ the way.”

“If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?” Mary said anxiously.

“There wouldn’t be no reason,” answered Martha. “You wouldn’t do no harm.”

Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but Martha stopped her.

“I’ve got somethin’ to tell you,” she said. “I thought I’d let you eat your dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin’ and I think he wants to see you.”

Mary turned quite pale.

“Oh!” she said. “Why! Why! He didn’t want to see me when I came. I heard Pitcher say he didn’t.”

“Well,” explained Martha, “Mrs. Medlock says it’s because o’ mother. She was walkin’ to Thwaite village an’ she met him. She’d never spoke to him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times. He’d forgot, but mother hadn’t an’ she made bold to stop him. I don’t know what she said to him about you but she said somethin’ as put him in th’ mind to see you before he goes away again, tomorrow.”

“Oh!” cried Mary, “is he going away tomorrow? I am so glad!”

“He’s goin’ for a long time. He mayn’t come back till autumn or winter. He’s goin’ to travel in foreign places. He’s always doin’ it.”

“Oh! I’m so glad—so glad!” said Mary thankfully.

If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least.

“When do you think he will want to see—”

She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Medlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man’s face on it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years ago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous and excited.

“Your hair’s rough,” she said quickly. “Go and brush it. Martha, help her to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him in his study.”

All the pink left Mary’s cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not even answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and her hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say? She was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and she would not like him. She knew what he would think of her.

She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At last Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when someone said, “Come in,” they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.

“This is Miss Mary, sir,” she said.

“You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to take her away,” said Mr. Craven.

When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. He turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.

“Come here!” he said.

Mary went to him.

He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the world to do with her.

“Are you well?” he asked.

“Yes,” answered Mary.

“Do they take good care of you?”

“Yes.”

He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.

“You are very thin,” he said.

“I am getting fatter,” Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest way.

What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her.

“I forgot you,” he said. “How could I remember you? I intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or someone of that sort, but I forgot.”

“Please,” began Mary. “Please—” and then the lump in her throat choked her.

“What do you want to say?” he inquired.

“I am—I am too big for a nurse,” said Mary. “And please—please don’t make me have a governess yet.”

He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.

“That was what the Sowerby woman said,” he muttered absent-mindedly.

Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.

“Is she—is she Martha’s mother?” she stammered.

“Yes, I think so,” he replied.

“She knows about children,” said Mary. “She has twelve. She knows.”

He seemed to rouse himself.

“What do you want to do?”

“I want to play out of doors,” Mary answered, hoping that her voice did not tremble. “I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter.”

He was watching her.

“Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,” he said. “She thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.”

“It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,” argued Mary.

“Where do you play?” he asked next.

“Everywhere,” gasped Mary. “Martha’s mother sent me a skipping-rope. I skip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth. I don’t do any harm.”

“Don’t look so frightened,” he said in a worried voice. “You could not do any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.”

Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to him.

“May I?” she said tremulously.

Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.

“Don’t look so frightened,” he exclaimed. “Of course you may. I am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time or attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you to be happy and comfortable. I don’t know anything about children, but Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you today because Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talked about you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about.”

“She knows all about children,” Mary said again in spite of herself.

“She ought to,” said Mr. Craven. “I thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to her.” It seemed hard for him to speak his dead wife’s name. “She is a respectable woman. Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out of doors as much as you like. It’s a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?” as if a sudden thought had struck him. “Do you want toys, books, dolls?”

“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”

In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven looked quite startled.

“Earth!” he repeated. “What do you mean?”

“To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,” Mary faltered.

He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes.

“Do you—care about gardens so much,” he said slowly.

“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary. “I was always ill and tired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them. But here it is different.”

Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.

“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.

“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said. “You remind me of someone else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see a bit of earth you want,” with something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it come alive.”

“May I take it from anywhere—if it’s not wanted?”

“Anywhere,” he answered. “There! You must go now, I am tired.” He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. “Good-by. I shall be away all summer.”

Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been waiting in the corridor.

“Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Craven said to her, “now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before she begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in the garden. Don’t look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh air and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage.”

Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not “look after” Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was fond of Martha’s mother.

“Thank you, sir,” she said. “Susan Sowerby and me went to school together and she’s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you’d find in a day’s walk. I never had any children myself and she’s had twelve, and there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm from them. I’d always take Susan Sowerby’s advice about children myself. She’s what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.”

“I understand,” Mr. Craven answered. “Take Miss Mary away now and send Pitcher to me.”

When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew back to her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact, hurried back after she had removed the dinner service.

“I can have my garden!” cried Mary. “I may have it where I like! I am not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to see me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me could not do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!”

“Eh!” said Martha delightedly, “that was nice of him wasn’t it?”

“Martha,” said Mary solemnly, “he is really a nice man, only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.”

She ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so much longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to set out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through the door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him. The gardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to them, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. He had gone away and the secret garden was empty—except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watching her.

“He’s gone,” she said woefully. “Oh! was he—was he—was he only a wood fairy?”

Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. It was a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had printed for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. There were some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At first she could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and they said:

“I will cum bak.”





CHAPTER XIII
“I AM COLIN”
Mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she showed it to Martha.

“Eh!” said Martha with great pride. “I never knew our Dickon was as clever as that. That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her nest, as large as life an’ twice as natural.”

Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!

She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking forward to the morning.

But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in torrents and the wind was “wuthering” round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry.

“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said. “It came because it knew I did not want it.”

She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not cry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the wind and its “wuthering.” She could not go to sleep again. The mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it “wuthered” and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!

“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying,” she said.

She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening. She listened and she listened.

“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper. “That isn’t the wind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.”

The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must find out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.

“I am going to find out what it is,” she said. “Everybody is in bed and I don’t care about Mrs. Medlock—I don’t care!”

There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry—the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself. The sound had come up that passage. So she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led her. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.

She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.

So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standing in the room!

It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully.

Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and was dreaming without knowing it.

The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He looked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain.

Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her breath. Then she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the light attracted the boy’s attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.

“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. “Are you a ghost?”

“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half frightened. “Are you one?”

He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them.

“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so. “I am Colin.”

“Who is Colin?” she faltered.

“I am Colin Craven. Who are you?”

“I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.”

“He is my father,” said the boy.

“Your father!” gasped Mary. “No one ever told me he had a boy! Why didn’t they?”

“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with an anxious expression.

She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.

“You are real, aren’t you?” he said. “I have such real dreams very often. You might be one of them.”

Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she put a piece of it between his fingers.

“Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,” she said. “I will pinch you a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I thought you might be a dream too.”

“Where did you come from?” he asked.

“From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn’t go to sleep and I heard someone crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you crying for?”

“Because I couldn’t go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me your name again.”

“Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?”

He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a little more as if he believed in her reality.

“No,” he answered. “They daren’t.”

“Why?” asked Mary.

“Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won’t let people see me and talk me over.”

“Why?” Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.

“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father won’t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live. My father hates to think I may be like him.”

“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said. “What a queer house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are locked up—and you! Have you been locked up?”

“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of it. It tires me too much.”

“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.

“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn’t want to see me.”

“Why?” Mary could not help asking again.

A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face.

“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me. He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard people talking. He almost hates me.”

“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half speaking to herself.

“What garden?” the boy asked.

“Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered. “Have you been here always?”

“Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but I won’t stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron thing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”

“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary. “Why do you keep looking at me like that?”

“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered rather fretfully. “Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t believe I’m awake.”

“We’re both awake,” said Mary. She glanced round the room with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light. “It looks quite like a dream, and it’s the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is asleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.”

“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly.

Mary thought of something all at once.

“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began, “do you want me to go away?”

He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.

“No,” he said. “I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear about you.”

Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the cushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay in the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.

“What do you want me to tell you?” she said.

He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to know which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had been doing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had lived before she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her tell him a great deal about India and about her voyage across the ocean. She found out that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things as other children had. One of his nurses had taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures in splendid books.

Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all sorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to have been amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything he did not like to do.

“Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,” he said indifferently. “It makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.”

He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary’s voice. As she went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or twice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject.

“How old are you?” he asked.

“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, “and so are you.”

“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice.

“Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was buried. And it has been locked for ten years.”

Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.

“What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?” he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.

“It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously. “He locked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the key.”

“What sort of a garden is it?” Colin persisted eagerly.

“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,” was Mary’s careful answer.

But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too had had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had attracted her. He asked question after question. Where was it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she never asked the gardeners?

“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary. “I think they have been told not to answer questions.”

“I would make them,” said Colin.

“Could you?” Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!

“Everyone is obliged to please me. I told you that,” he said. “If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know that. I would make them tell me.”

Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see quite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the whole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living.

“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because she was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.

“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently as he had spoken before. “Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say I shan’t. At first they thought I was too little to understand and now they think I don’t hear. But I do. My doctor is my father’s cousin. He is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my father is dead. I should think he wouldn’t want me to live.”

“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary.

“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. “But I don’t want to die. When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.”

“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I did not know who it was. Were you crying about that?” She did so want him to forget the garden.

“I dare say,” he answered. “Let us talk about something else. Talk about that garden. Don’t you want to see it?”

“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice.

“I do,” he went on persistently. “I don’t think I ever really wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dug up. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my chair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open the door.”

He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like stars and looked more immense than ever.

“They have to please me,” he said. “I will make them take me there and I will let you go, too.”

Mary’s hands clutched each other. Everything would be spoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.

“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do that!” she cried out.

He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!

“Why?” he exclaimed. “You said you wanted to see it.”

“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat, “but if you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret again.”

He leaned still farther forward.

“A secret,” he said. “What do you mean? Tell me.”

Mary’s words almost tumbled over one another.

“You see—you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but ourselves—if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if there was—and we could find it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind us, and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our garden and pretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it all come alive—”

“Is it dead?” he interrupted her.

“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on. “The bulbs will live but the roses—”

He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.

“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly.

“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the earth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.”

“Is the spring coming?” he said. “What is it like? You don’t see it in rooms if you are ill.”

“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine, and things pushing up and working under the earth,” said Mary. “If the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don’t you see? Oh, don’t you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?”

He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his face.

“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about not living to grow up. They don’t know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But I like this kind better.”

“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded Mary, “perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. And then—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a secret garden.”

“I should—like—that,” he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. “I should like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.”

Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if she kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.

“I’ll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,” she said. “It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangle perhaps.”

He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the roses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hung down—about the many birds which might have built their nests there because it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.

“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said. “But if you stay in a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as if you had been inside that garden.”

She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently did not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.

“I am going to let you look at something,” he said. “Do you see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?”

Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a curtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.

“Yes,” she answered.

“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin. “Go and pull it.”

Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the silk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them.

“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly. “I don’t see why she died. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”

“How queer!” said Mary.

“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,” he grumbled. “I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back. Draw the curtain again.”

Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.

“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are just like yours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtain drawn over her?”

He moved uncomfortably.

“I made them do it,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t like to see her looking at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone to see her.”

There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.

“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?” she inquired.

“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered. “And I should tell her that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad you came.”

“So am I,” said Mary. “I will come as often as I can, but”—she hesitated—“I shall have to look every day for the garden door.”

“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about it afterward.”

He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke again.

“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said. “I will not tell them until they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and say that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?”

“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary. “She waits on me.”

He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.

“She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when to come here.”

Then Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she had asked questions about the crying.

“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said.

“Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and then Martha comes.”

“I have been here a long time,” said Mary. “Shall I go away now? Your eyes look sleepy.”

“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,” he said rather shyly.

“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, “and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and stroke it and sing something quite low.”

“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily.

Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she leaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little chanting song in Hindustani.

“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were lying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without making a sound.





CHAPTER XIV
A YOUNG RAJAH
The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped pouring down. There could be no going out of doors. Martha was so busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. She came bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing nothing else.

“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they sat down. “Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”

“I have. I have found out what the crying was,” said Mary.

Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes.

“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed. “Never!”

“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on. “And I got up and went to see where it came from. It was Colin. I found him.”

Martha’s face became red with fright.

“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying. “Tha’ shouldn’t have done it—tha’ shouldn’t! Tha’ll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin’ about him—but tha’ll get me in trouble. I shall lose my place and what’ll mother do!”

“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary. “He was glad I came. We talked and talked and he said he was glad I came.”

“Was he?” cried Martha. “Art tha’ sure? Tha’ doesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him. He’s a big lad to cry like a baby, but when he’s in a passion he’ll fair scream just to frighten us. He knows us daren’t call our souls our own.”

“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary. “I asked him if I should go away and he made me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and talked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He wouldn’t let me go. He let me see his mother’s picture. Before I left him I sang him to sleep.”

Martha fairly gasped with amazement.

“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested. “It’s as if tha’d walked straight into a lion’s den. If he’d been like he is most times he’d have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th’ house. He won’t let strangers look at him.”

“He let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked at me. We stared!” said Mary.

“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha. “If Mrs. Medlock finds out, she’ll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be packed back to mother.”

“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It’s to be a sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly. “And he says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”

“Aye, that’s true enough—th’ bad lad!” sighed Martha, wiping her forehead with her apron.

“He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to him every day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.”

“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place—I shall for sure!”

“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is ordered to obey him,” Mary argued.

“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes, “that he was nice to thee!”

“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered.

“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha, drawing a long breath.

“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary. “I’ve heard about Magic in India, but I can’t make it. I just went into his room and I was so surprised to see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared at me. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was. And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each other questions. And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not.”

“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha.

“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary.

“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha. “Mr. Craven went off his head like when he was born. Th’ doctors thought he’d have to be put in a ’sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. He wouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby. He just raved and said it’d be another hunchback like him and it’d better die.”

“Is Colin a hunchback?” Mary asked. “He didn’t look like one.”

“He isn’t yet,” said Martha. “But he began all wrong. Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th’ house to set any child wrong. They was afraid his back was weak an’ they’ve always been takin’ care of it—keepin’ him lyin’ down and not lettin’ him walk. Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a big doctor came to see him an’ made them take it off. He talked to th’ other doctor quite rough—in a polite way. He said there’d been too much medicine and too much lettin’ him have his own way.”

“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.

“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha. “I won’t say as he hasn’t been ill a good bit. He’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an’ once he had typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He’d been out of his head an’ she was talkin’ to th’ nurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know nothin’, an’ she said, ‘He’ll die this time sure enough, an’ best thing for him an’ for everybody.’ An’ she looked at him an’ there he was with his big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible as she was herself. She didn’t know wha’d happen but he just stared at her an’ says, ‘You give me some water an’ stop talkin’.’”

“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary.

“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live that gets no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie on his back an’ read picture-books an’ take medicine. He’s weak and hates th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’ doors, an’ he gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill.”

Mary sat and looked at the fire.

“I wonder,” she said slowly, “if it would not do him good to go out into a garden and watch things growing. It did me good.”

“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain. He’d been readin’ in a paper about people gettin’ somethin’ he called ‘rose cold’ an’ he began to sneeze an’ said he’d got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t know th’ rules passed by an’ looked at him curious. He threw himself into a passion an’ he said he’d looked at him because he was going to be a hunchback. He cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”

“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see him again,” said Mary.

“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha. “Tha’ may as well know that at th’ start.”

Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.

“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,” she said. “I hope he’s in a good temper.”

She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a puzzled expression.

“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said. “He’s up on his sofa with his picture-books. He’s told the nurse to stay away until six o’clock. I’m to wait in the next room. Th’ minute she was gone he called me to him an’ says, ‘I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember you’re not to tell anyone.’ You’d better go as quick as you can.”

Mary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin as much as she wanted to see Dickon; but she wanted to see him very much.

There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and in the daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain. Colin looked rather like a picture himself. He was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded cushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.

“Come in,” he said. “I’ve been thinking about you all morning.”

“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary. “You don’t know how frightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away.”

He frowned.

“Go and tell her to come here,” he said. “She is in the next room.”

Mary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes. Colin was still frowning.

“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded.

“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered, turning quite red.

“Has Medlock to do what I please?”

“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha.

“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock send you away if she finds it out?”

“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha.

“I’ll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,” said Master Craven grandly. “She wouldn’t like that, I can tell you.”

“Thank you, sir,” bobbing a curtsy, “I want to do my duty, sir.”

“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still. “I’ll take care of you. Now go away.”

When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at him as if he had set her wondering.

“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her. “What are you thinking about?”

“I am thinking about two things.”

“What are they? Sit down and tell me.”

“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the big stool. “Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you spoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in a minute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”

“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said, “but first tell me what the second thing was.”

“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are from Dickon.”

“Who is Dickon?” he said. “What a queer name!”

She might as well tell him, she thought she could talk about Dickon without mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talk about him. Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to bring him nearer.

“He is Martha’s brother. He is twelve years old,” she explained. “He is not like anyone else in the world. He can charm foxes and squirrels and birds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen.”

There were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one suddenly toward him.

“There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed. “Come and look at it.”

The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he turned to one of them.

“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly.

“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained. “But he doesn’t call it Magic. He says it’s because he lives on the moor so much and he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he was a bird or a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robin questions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”

Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and the spots on his cheeks burned.

“Tell me some more about him,” he said.

“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on. “And he knows where foxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that other boys won’t find their holes and frighten them. He knows about everything that grows or lives on the moor.”

“Does he like the moor?” said Colin. “How can he when it’s such a great, bare, dreary place?”

“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary. “Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing or squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun under the earth or in the trees or heather. It’s their world.”

“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his elbow to look at her.

“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary suddenly remembering. “I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous. Martha told me about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and all full of bees and butterflies.”

“You never see anything if you are ill,” said Colin restlessly. He looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering what it was.

“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary.

“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone.

Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.

“You might—sometime.”

He moved as if he were startled.

“Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.”

“How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically. She didn’t like the way he had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic. She felt rather as if he almost boasted about it.

“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered crossly. “They are always whispering about it and thinking I don’t notice. They wish I would, too.”

Mistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.

“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t. Who wishes you would?”

“The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would get Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren’t say so, but he always looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his face got quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.”

“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately.

That made Colin turn and look at her again.

“Don’t you?” he said.

And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were thinking. And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both of them thinking strange things children do not usually think of.

“I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the iron thing off,” said Mary at last “Did he say you were going to die?”

“No.”

“What did he say?”

“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered. “Perhaps he knew I hated whispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, ‘The lad might live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.’ It sounded as if he was in a temper.”

“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,” said Mary reflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way or the other. “I believe Dickon would. He’s always talking about live things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill. He’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking down at the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries.”

She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changed at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.

“See here,” she said. “Don’t let us talk about dying; I don’t like it. Let us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then we will look at your pictures.”

It was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon’s mother—and the skipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before. And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together. And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures—instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.

They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and his robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his weak back, when he suddenly remembered something.

“Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,” he said. “We are cousins.”

It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had got into the humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun the door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.

Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back because he had accidentally bumped against her.

“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes almost starting out of her head. “Good Lord!”

“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward. “What does it mean?”

Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as if neither the doctor’s alarm nor Mrs. Medlock’s terror were of the slightest consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and dog had walked into the room.

“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said. “I asked her to come and talk to me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send for her.”

Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.

“Oh, sir” she panted. “I don’t know how it’s happened. There’s not a servant on the place tha’d dare to talk—they all have their orders.”

“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin. “She heard me crying and found me herself. I am glad she came. Don’t be silly, Medlock.”

Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain that he dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt his pulse.

“I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not good for you, my boy,” he said.

“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin, his eyes beginning to look dangerously sparkling. “I am better. She makes me better. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have tea together.”

Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but there was evidently nothing to be done.

“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock. “But”—thinking the matter over—“he looked better this morning before she came into the room.”

“She came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. She sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,” said Colin. “I was better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea now. Tell nurse, Medlock.”

Dr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a few minutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to Colin. He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget.

Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face.

“I want to forget it,” he said at last. “She makes me forget it. That is why I want her.”

Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzled glance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become a stiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was. The boy actually did look brighter, however—and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor.

“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t want to,” said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the sofa. “Now, if you’ll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot. Tell me about Rajahs.”





CHAPTER XV
NEST BUILDING
After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot. Though there had been no chance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent hours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.

“You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go following things up like you did that night,” Mrs. Medlock said once. “But there’s no saying it’s not been a sort of blessing to the lot of us. He’s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of him, but she says she doesn’t mind staying now you’ve gone on duty with her,” laughing a little.

In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out from him, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct questions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him long enough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If he could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn’t it be possible to take him to the garden without having anyone find it out? The grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would not mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal of fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India. This child looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.

“Th’ air from th’ moor has done thee good already,” she had said. “Tha’rt not nigh so yeller and tha’rt not nigh so scrawny. Even tha’ hair doesn’t slamp down on tha’ head so flat. It’s got some life in it so as it sticks out a bit.”

“It’s like me,” said Mary. “It’s growing stronger and fatter. I’m sure there’s more of it.”

“It looks it, for sure,” said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her face. “Tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s that way an’ there’s a bit o’ red in tha’ cheeks.”

If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be good for Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps he would not like to see Dickon.

“Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?” she inquired one day.

“I always hated it,” he answered, “even when I was very little. Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn’t live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say ‘Poor child!’ Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.”

“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary, not at all admiringly.

“I don’t care what she thought,” said Colin, frowning.

“I wonder why you didn’t scream and bite me when I came into your room?” said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.

“I thought you were a ghost or a dream,” he said. “You can’t bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they don’t care.”

“Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?” Mary asked uncertainly.

He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.

“There’s one boy,” he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking over every word, “there’s one boy I believe I shouldn’t mind. It’s that boy who knows where the foxes live—Dickon.”

“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind him,” said Mary.

“The birds don’t and other animals,” he said, still thinking it over, “perhaps that’s why I shouldn’t. He’s a sort of animal charmer and I am a boy animal.”

Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny indeed.

What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.

On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a concert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.

“It’s warm—warm!” she said. “It will make the green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth.”

She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could, breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because she remembered what Dickon’s mother had said about the end of his nose quivering like a rabbit’s.

“It must be very early,” she said. “The little clouds are all pink and I’ve never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I don’t even hear the stable boys.”

A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.

“I can’t wait! I am going to see the garden!”

She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there she was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ran around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.

“It is all different already,” she said. “The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.”

The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which bordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.

When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw—caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the grass working hard.

Mary flew across the grass to him.

“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she cried out. “How could you get here so early! How could you! The sun has only just got up!”

He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like a bit of the sky.

“Eh!” he said. “I was up long before him. How could I have stayed abed! Th’ world’s all fair begun again this mornin’, it has. An’ it’s workin’ an’ hummin’ an’ scratchin’ an’ pipin’ an’ nest-buildin’ an’ breathin’ out scents, till you’ve got to be out on it ’stead o’ lyin’ on your back. When th’ sun did jump up, th’ moor went mad for joy, an’ I was in the midst of th’ heather, an’ I run like mad myself, shoutin’ an’ singin’. An’ I come straight here. I couldn’t have stayed away. Why, th’ garden was lyin’ here waitin’!”

Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been running herself.

“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she said. “I’m so happy I can scarcely breathe!”

Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose from its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawing once, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.

“This is th’ little fox cub,” he said, rubbing the little reddish animal’s head. “It’s named Captain. An’ this here’s Soot. Soot he flew across th’ moor with me an’ Captain he run same as if th’ hounds had been after him. They both felt same as I did.”

Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary. When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and Captain trotted quietly close to his side.

“See here!” said Dickon. “See how these has pushed up, an’ these an’ these! An’ Eh! Look at these here!”

He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him. They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold. Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.

“You never kiss a person in that way,” she said when she lifted her head. “Flowers are so different.”

He looked puzzled but smiled.

“Eh!” he said, “I’ve kissed mother many a time that way when I come in from th’ moor after a day’s roamin’ an’ she stood there at th’ door in th’ sun, lookin’ so glad an’ comfortable.”

They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low. He showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead. He showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary’s hair was as tumbled as Dickon’s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.

There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stood quite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.

“We munnot stir,” he whispered in broad Yorkshire. “We munnot scarce breathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin’ when I seed him last. It’s Ben Weatherstaff’s robin. He’s buildin’ his nest. He’ll stay here if us don’t flight him.”

They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.

“Us mustn’t seem as if us was watchin’ him too close,” said Dickon. “He’d be out with us for good if he got th’ notion us was interferin’ now. He’ll be a good bit different till all this is over. He’s settin’ up housekeepin’. He’ll be shyer an’ readier to take things ill. He’s got no time for visitin’ an’ gossipin’. Us must keep still a bit an’ try to look as if us was grass an’ trees an’ bushes. Then when he’s got used to seein’ us I’ll chirp a bit an’ he’ll know us’ll not be in his way.”

Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he only sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such a softness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.

“It’s part o’ th’ springtime, this nest-buildin’ is,” he said. “I warrant it’s been goin’ on in th’ same way every year since th’ world was begun. They’ve got their way o’ thinkin’ and doin’ things an’ a body had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easier than any other season if you’re too curious.”

“If we talk about him I can’t help looking at him,” Mary said as softly as possible. “We must talk of something else. There is something I want to tell you.”

“He’ll like it better if us talks o’ somethin’ else,” said Dickon. “What is it tha’s got to tell me?”

“Well—do you know about Colin?” she whispered.

He turned his head to look at her.

“What does tha’ know about him?” he asked.

“I’ve seen him. I have been to talk to him every day this week. He wants me to come. He says I’m making him forget about being ill and dying,” answered Mary.

Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from his round face.

“I am glad o’ that,” he exclaimed. “I’m right down glad. It makes me easier. I knowed I must say nothin’ about him an’ I don’t like havin’ to hide things.”

“Don’t you like hiding the garden?” said Mary.

“I’ll never tell about it,” he answered. “But I says to mother, ‘Mother,’ I says, ‘I got a secret to keep. It’s not a bad ’un, tha’ knows that. It’s no worse than hidin’ where a bird’s nest is. Tha’ doesn’t mind it, does tha’?’”

Mary always wanted to hear about mother.

“What did she say?” she asked, not at all afraid to hear.

Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly.

“It was just like her, what she said,” he answered. “She give my head a bit of a rub an’ laughed an’ she says, ‘Eh, lad, tha’ can have all th’ secrets tha’ likes. I’ve knowed thee twelve year’.’”

“How did you know about Colin?” asked Mary.

“Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad as was like to be a cripple, an’ they knowed Mester Craven didn’t like him to be talked about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs. Craven was such a pretty young lady an’ they was so fond of each other. Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an’ she doesn’t mind talkin’ to mother before us children, because she knows us has been brought up to be trusty. How did tha’ find out about him? Martha was in fine trouble th’ last time she came home. She said tha’d heard him frettin’ an’ tha’ was askin’ questions an’ she didn’t know what to say.”

Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which had wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining voice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had ended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the carven four-posted bed in the corner. When she described the small ivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his head.

“Them’s just like his mother’s eyes, only hers was always laughin’, they say,” he said. “They say as Mr. Craven can’t bear to see him when he’s awake an’ it’s because his eyes is so like his mother’s an’ yet looks so different in his miserable bit of a face.”

“Do you think he wants to die?” whispered Mary.

“No, but he wishes he’d never been born. Mother she says that’s th’ worst thing on earth for a child. Them as is not wanted scarce ever thrives. Mester Craven he’d buy anythin’ as money could buy for th’ poor lad but he’d like to forget as he’s on earth. For one thing, he’s afraid he’ll look at him some day and find he’s growed hunchback.”

“Colin’s so afraid of it himself that he won’t sit up,” said Mary. “He says he’s always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he should go crazy and scream himself to death.”

“Eh! he oughtn’t to lie there thinkin’ things like that,” said Dickon. “No lad could get well as thought them sort o’ things.”

The fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to ask for a pat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and thought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden.

“When first we got in here,” he said, “it seemed like everything was gray. Look round now and tell me if tha’ doesn’t see a difference.”

Mary looked and caught her breath a little.

“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mist were creeping over it. It’s almost like a green gauze veil.”

“Aye,” said Dickon. “An’ it’ll be greener and greener till th’ gray’s all gone. Can tha’ guess what I was thinkin’?”

“I know it was something nice,” said Mary eagerly. “I believe it was something about Colin.”

“I was thinkin’ that if he was out here he wouldn’t be watchin’ for lumps to grow on his back; he’d be watchin’ for buds to break on th’ rose-bushes, an’ he’d likely be healthier,” explained Dickon. “I was wonderin’ if us could ever get him in th’ humor to come out here an’ lie under th’ trees in his carriage.”

“I’ve been wondering that myself. I’ve thought of it almost every time I’ve talked to him,” said Mary. “I’ve wondered if he could keep a secret and I’ve wondered if we could bring him here without anyone seeing us. I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobey him. He won’t go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad if he will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to keep away so they wouldn’t find out.”

Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain’s back.

“It’d be good for him, I’ll warrant,” he said. “Us’d not be thinkin’ he’d better never been born. Us’d be just two children watchin’ a garden grow, an’ he’d be another. Two lads an’ a little lass just lookin’ on at th’ springtime. I warrant it’d be better than doctor’s stuff.”

“He’s been lying in his room so long and he’s always been so afraid of his back that it has made him queer,” said Mary. “He knows a good many things out of books but he doesn’t know anything else. He says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates gardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden because it is a secret. I daren’t tell him much but he said he wanted to see it.”

“Us’ll have him out here sometime for sure,” said Dickon. “I could push his carriage well enough. Has tha’ noticed how th’ robin an’ his mate has been workin’ while we’ve been sittin’ here? Look at him perched on that branch wonderin’ where it’d be best to put that twig he’s got in his beak.”

He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head and looked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to him as Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon’s tone was one of friendly advice.

“Wheres’ever tha’ puts it,” he said, “it’ll be all right. Tha’ knew how to build tha’ nest before tha’ came out o’ th’ egg. Get on with thee, lad. Tha’st got no time to lose.”

“Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!” Mary said, laughing delightedly. “Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and he hops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he likes it. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at him than not be noticed.”

Dickon laughed too and went on talking.

“Tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee,” he said to the robin. “Us is near bein’ wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin’ too, bless thee. Look out tha’ doesn’t tell on us.”

And though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied, Mary knew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the garden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not tell their secret for the world.





CHAPTER XVI
“I WON’T!” SAID MARY
They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in returning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.

“Tell Colin that I can’t come and see him yet,” she said to Martha. “I’m very busy in the garden.”

Martha looked rather frightened.

“Eh! Miss Mary,” she said, “it may put him all out of humor when I tell him that.”

But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not a self-sacrificing person.

“I can’t stay,” she answered. “Dickon’s waiting for me;” and she ran away.

The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been. Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a spade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that by this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a “gardener’s garden” it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime was over.

“There’ll be apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms overhead,” Dickon said, working away with all his might. “An’ there’ll be peach an’ plum trees in bloom against th’ walls, an’ th’ grass’ll be a carpet o’ flowers.”

The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once when Dickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.

“Tha’s a good bit stronger than tha’ was,” Dickon said, looking at her as she was digging. “Tha’s beginning to look different, for sure.”

Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.

“I’m getting fatter and fatter every day,” she said quite exultantly. “Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says my hair is growing thicker. It isn’t so flat and stringy.”

The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slanting under the trees when they parted.

“It’ll be fine tomorrow,” said Dickon. “I’ll be at work by sunrise.”

“So will I,” said Mary.

She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. She wanted to tell Colin about Dickon’s fox cub and the rook and about what the springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. So it was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see Martha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.

“What is the matter?” she asked. “What did Colin say when you told him I couldn’t come?”

“Eh!” said Martha, “I wish tha’d gone. He was nigh goin’ into one o’ his tantrums. There’s been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet. He would watch the clock all th’ time.”

Mary’s lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used to considering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. She knew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other people ill and nervous, too. When she had had a headache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quite right; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.

He was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat on his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in. This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff manner.

“Why didn’t you get up?” she said.

“I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,” he answered, without looking at her. “I made them put me back in bed this afternoon. My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn’t you come?”

“I was working in the garden with Dickon,” said Mary.

Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.

“I won’t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of coming to talk to me,” he said.

Mary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion without making a noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened.

“If you send Dickon away, I’ll never come into this room again!” she retorted.

“You’ll have to if I want you,” said Colin.

“I won’t!” said Mary.

“I’ll make you,” said Colin. “They shall drag you in.”

“Shall they, Mr. Rajah!” said Mary fiercely. “They may drag me in but they can’t make me talk when they get me here. I’ll sit and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing. I won’t even look at you. I’ll stare at the floor!”

They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If they had been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to it.

“You are a selfish thing!” cried Colin.

“What are you?” said Mary. “Selfish people always say that. Anyone is selfish who doesn’t do what they want. You’re more selfish than I am. You’re the most selfish boy I ever saw.”

“I’m not!” snapped Colin. “I’m not as selfish as your fine Dickon is! He keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself. He’s selfish, if you like!”

Mary’s eyes flashed fire.

“He’s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!” she said. “He’s—he’s like an angel!” It might sound rather silly to say that but she did not care.

“A nice angel!” Colin sneered ferociously. “He’s a common cottage boy off the moor!”

“He’s better than a common Rajah!” retorted Mary. “He’s a thousand times better!”

Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the better of him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone like himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that. He turned his head on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek. He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for himself—not for anyone else.

“I’m not as selfish as you, because I’m always ill, and I’m sure there is a lump coming on my back,” he said. “And I am going to die besides.”

“You’re not!” contradicted Mary unsympathetically.

He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard such a thing said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be both at one time.

“I’m not?” he cried. “I am! You know I am! Everybody says so.”

“I don’t believe it!” said Mary sourly. “You just say that to make people sorry. I believe you’re proud of it. I don’t believe it! If you were a nice boy it might be true—but you’re too nasty!”

In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage.

“Get out of the room!” he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and threw it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell at her feet, but Mary’s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.

“I’m going,” she said. “And I won’t come back!”

She walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and spoke again.

“I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,” she said. “Dickon brought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all about them. Now I won’t tell you a single thing!”

She marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to her great astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had been listening and, more amazing still—she was laughing. She was a big handsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all, as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha or anyone else who would take her place. Mary had never liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief..

“What are you laughing at?” she asked her.

“At you two young ones,” said the nurse. “It’s the best thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have someone to stand up to him that’s as spoiled as himself;” and she laughed into her handkerchief again. “If he’d had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it would have been the saving of him.”

“Is he going to die?”

“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said the nurse. “Hysterics and temper are half what ails him.”

“What are hysterics?” asked Mary.

“You’ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this—but at any rate you’ve given him something to have hysterics about, and I’m glad of it.”

Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she had come in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the great secret. She had been beginning to think it would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely. She would never tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked! It would serve him right! She felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor.

Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden box on the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages.

“Mr. Craven sent it to you,” said Martha. “It looks as if it had picture-books in it.”

Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room. “Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?” She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do with it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were full of pictures. There were two or three games and there was a beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.

Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart grew quite warm.

“I can write better than I can print,” she said, “and the first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much obliged.”

If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her presents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he would have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. It gave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked so frightened himself. He said that if he felt even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his mind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father’s back had begun to show its crookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told anyone but Mary that most of his “tantrums” as they called them grew out of his hysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had told her.

“He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,” she said to herself. “And he has been cross today. Perhaps—perhaps he has been thinking about it all afternoon.”

She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.

“I said I would never go back again—” she hesitated, knitting her brows—“but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he wants me—in the morning. Perhaps he’ll try to throw his pillow at me again, but—I think—I’ll go.”





CHAPTER XVII
A TANTRUM
She had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed. As she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself:

“I’ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward—I believe—I’ll go to see him.”

She thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by such dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What was it—what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doors were opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and someone was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible way.

“It’s Colin,” she said. “He’s having one of those tantrums the nurse called hysterics. How awful it sounds.”

As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people were so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather than hear them. She put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering.

“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do,” she kept saying. “I can’t bear it.”

Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she remembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps the sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her. She was not used to anyone’s tempers but her own. She took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.

“He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody ought to beat him!” she cried out.

Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means. She even looked rather pale.

“He’s worked himself into hysterics,” she said in a great hurry. “He’ll do himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You come and try, like a good child. He likes you.”

“He turned me out of the room this morning,” said Mary, stamping her foot with excitement.

The stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had been afraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under the bed-clothes.

“That’s right,” she said. “You’re in the right humor. You go and scold him. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child, as quick as ever you can.”

It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been funny as well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-up people were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself.

She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door. She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the four-posted bed.

“You stop!” she almost shouted. “You stop! I hate you! Everybody hates you! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream yourself to death! You will scream yourself to death in a minute, and I wish you would!”

A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict.

He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom.

“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream too—and I can scream louder than you can and I’ll frighten you, I’ll frighten you!”

He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. The scream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were streaming down his face and he shook all over.

“I can’t stop!” he gasped and sobbed. “I can’t—I can’t!”

“You can!” shouted Mary. “Half that ails you is hysterics and temper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!” and she stamped each time she said it.

“I felt the lump—I felt it,” choked out Colin. “I knew I should. I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,” and he began to writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn’t scream.

“You didn’t feel a lump!” contradicted Mary fiercely. “If you did it was only a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps. There’s nothing the matter with your horrid back—nothing but hysterics! Turn over and let me look at it!”

She liked the word “hysterics” and felt somehow as if it had an effect on him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.

“Nurse,” she commanded, “come here and show me his back this minute!”

The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together near the door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three had gasped with fright more than once. The nurse came forward as if she were half afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.

“Perhaps he—he won’t let me,” she hesitated in a low voice.

Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:

“Sh-show her! She-she’ll see then!”

It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute’s silence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary looked up and down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she had been the great doctor from London.

“There’s not a single lump there!” she said at last. “There’s not a lump as big as a pin—except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them because you’re thin. I’ve got backbone lumps myself, and they used to stick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to hide them. There’s not a lump as big as a pin! If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh!”

No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him. If he had ever had anyone to talk to about his secret terrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he had had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that most of his fright and illness was created by himself. But he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.

“I didn’t know,” ventured the nurse, “that he thought he had a lump on his spine. His back is weak because he won’t try to sit up. I could have told him there was no lump there.” Colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her.

“C-could you?” he said pathetically.

“Yes, sir.”

“There!” said Mary, and she gulped too.

Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn broken breaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay still for a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come to him. Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her.

“Do you think—I could—live to grow up?” he said.

The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat some of the London doctor’s words.

“You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give way to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.”

Colin’s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and this perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little toward Mary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantum having passed, she was softened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sort of making up.

“I’ll—I’ll go out with you, Mary,” he said. “I shan’t hate fresh air if we can find—” He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying “if we can find the secret garden” and he ended, “I shall like to go out with you if Dickon will come and push my chair. I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the crow.”

The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows. Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also. She was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed her big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin’s hand.

“You must go back and get your sleep out,” she said. “He’ll drop off after a while—if he’s not too upset. Then I’ll lie down myself in the next room.”

“Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?” Mary whispered to Colin.

His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her appealingly.

“Oh, yes!” he answered. “It’s such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in a minute.”

“I will put him to sleep,” Mary said to the yawning nurse. “You can go if you like.”

“Well,” said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. “If he doesn’t go to sleep in half an hour you must call me.”

“Very well,” answered Mary.

The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone Colin pulled Mary’s hand again.

“I almost told,” he said; “but I stopped myself in time. I won’t talk and I’ll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things to tell me. Have you—do you think you have found out anything at all about the way into the secret garden?”

Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heart relented.

“Ye-es,” she answered, “I think I have. And if you will go to sleep I will tell you tomorrow.” His hand quite trembled.

“Oh, Mary!” he said. “Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I should live to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.”

“Yes,” answered Mary. “Shut your eyes.”

He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began to speak very slowly and in a very low voice.

“I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into a lovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground—almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died but many—are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now the spring has begun—perhaps—perhaps—”

The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she saw it and went on.

“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now. Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything. And the birds are coming to look at it—because it is—so safe and still. And perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—” very softly and slowly indeed, “the robin has found a mate—and is building a nest.”

And Colin was asleep.





CHAPTER XVIII
“THA’ MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME”
Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning. She slept late because she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told her that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ate her breakfast slowly as she listened.

“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon as tha’ can,” Martha said. “It’s queer what a fancy he’s took to thee. Tha’ did give it him last night for sure—didn’t tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him. Mother says as th’ two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own way—or always to have it. She doesn’t know which is th’ worst. Tha’ was in a fine temper tha’self, too. But he says to me when I went into his room, ‘Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please come an’ talk to me?’ Think o’ him saying please! Will you go, Miss?”

“I’ll run and see Dickon first,” said Mary. “No, I’ll go and see Colin first and tell him—I know what I’ll tell him,” with a sudden inspiration.

She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room and for a second he looked disappointed. He was in bed. His face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his eyes.

“I’m glad you came,” he said. “My head aches and I ache all over because I’m so tired. Are you going somewhere?”

Mary went and leaned against his bed.

“I won’t be long,” she said. “I’m going to Dickon, but I’ll come back. Colin, it’s—it’s something about the garden.”

His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.

“Oh! is it?” he cried out. “I dreamed about it all night. I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still. I’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”

In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and the crow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels.

“I came over on the pony this mornin’,” he said. “Eh! he is a good little chap—Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here one he’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s called Shell.”

When he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and when he said “Shell” the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.

When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the look in Dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind. She could see he felt sorrier for Colin than she did. He looked up at the sky and all about him.

“Just listen to them birds—th’ world seems full of ’em—all whistlin’ an’ pipin’,” he said. “Look at ’em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ’em callin’ to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th’ world’s callin’. The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see ’em—an’, my word, th’ nice smells there is about!” sniffing with his happy turned-up nose. “An’ that poor lad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets to thinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’. Eh! my! we mun get him out here—we mun get him watchin’ an listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’ get him just soaked through wi’ sunshine. An’ we munnot lose no time about it.”

When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could better understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.

“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed, we must”). “I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him very much. “He’s took a graidely fancy to thee. He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an’ Captain. When I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him if tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow mornin’—an’ bring tha’ creatures wi’ thee—an’ then—in a bit, when there’s more leaves out, an’ happen a bud or two, we’ll get him to come out an’ tha’ shall push him in his chair an’ we’ll bring him here an’ show him everything.”

When she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made a long speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.

“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,” Dickon chuckled. “Tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt as good for ill folk as laughin’ is. Mother says she believes as half a hour’s good laugh every mornin’ ’ud cure a chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”

“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,” said Mary, chuckling herself.

The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes. But she went back to the house and when she sat down close to Colin’s bed he began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.

“You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,” he cried out quite joyously. “What is it you smell of? It’s cool and warm and sweet all at the same time.”

“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary. “It comes o’ sittin’ on th’ grass under a tree wi’ Dickon an’ wi’ Captain an’ Soot an’ Nut an’ Shell. It’s th’ springtime an’ out o’ doors an’ sunshine as smells so graidely.”

She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadly Yorkshire sounds until you have heard someone speak it. Colin began to laugh.

“What are you doing?” he said. “I never heard you talk like that before. How funny it sounds.”

“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered Mary triumphantly. “I canna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’ Martha can but tha’ sees I can shape a bit. Doesn’t tha’ understand a bit o’ Yorkshire when tha’ hears it? An’ tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’ bred an’ born! Eh! I wonder tha’rt not ashamed o’ thy face.”

And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.

“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself because there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished. “Whoever heard th’ like! Whoever on earth would ha’ thought it!”

There was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump. He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose. He was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs. He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him give Mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.

“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?” Colin asked.

“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary. “Dickon says anything will understand if you’re friends with it for sure, but you have to be friends for sure.”

Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.

“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last, “but I’m not. I never had anything to be friends with, and I can’t bear people.”

“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary.

“Yes, I can,” he answered. “It’s funny but I even like you.”

“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary. “He said he’d warrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him too. We are all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked. But I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.”

“Did you feel as if you hated people?”

“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation. “I should have detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.”

Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.

“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about sending Dickon away. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed at you but—but perhaps he is.”

“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly, “because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshire angel—I believe he’d understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they’d know he was friends for sure.”

“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin; “I want to see him.”

“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary, “because—because—”

Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell him. Colin knew something new was coming.

“Because what?” he cried eagerly.

Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught hold of both his hands.

“Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can I trust you—for sure—for sure?” she implored.

Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.

“Yes—yes!”

“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he’ll bring his creatures with him.”

“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight.

“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement. “The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is under the ivy on the wall.”

If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted “Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak and rather hysterical; his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.

“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob. “Shall I see it? Shall I get into it? Shall I live to get into it?” and he clutched her hands and dragged her toward him.

“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly. “Of course you’ll live to get into it! Don’t be silly!”

And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and Colin’s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listening enraptured.

“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last. “It sounds just as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told me first.”

Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.

“I had seen it—and I had been in,” she said. “I found the key and got in weeks ago. But I daren’t tell you—I daren’t because I was so afraid I couldn’t trust you—for sure!”





CHAPTER XIX
“IT HAS COME!”
Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had his tantrum. He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away from Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.

“How is he?” he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived. “He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.”

“Well, sir,” answered Mrs. Medlock, “you’ll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him. That plain sour-faced child that’s almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him. How she’s done it there’s no telling. The Lord knows she’s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like a little cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop, and this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir. It’s past crediting.”

The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient’s room was indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he heard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in his dressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment.

“Those long spires of blue ones—we’ll have a lot of those,” Colin was announcing. “They’re called Del-phin-iums.”

“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big and grand,” cried Mistress Mary. “There are clumps there already.”

Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colin looked fretful.

“I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,” Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.

“I’m better now—much better,” Colin answered, rather like a Rajah. “I’m going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine. I want some fresh air.”

Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him curiously.

“It must be a very fine day,” he said, “and you must be very careful not to tire yourself.”

“Fresh air won’t tire me,” said the young Rajah.

As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and kill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled.

“I thought you did not like fresh air,” he said.

“I don’t when I am by myself,” replied the Rajah; “but my cousin is going out with me.”

“And the nurse, of course?” suggested Dr. Craven.

“No, I will not have the nurse,” so magnificently that Mary could not help remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his diamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubies on the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approach with salaams and receive his orders.

“My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she is with me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know will push my carriage.”

Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.

“He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,” he said. “And I must know something about him. Who is he? What is his name?”

“It’s Dickon,” Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw that in a moment Dr. Craven’s serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.

“Oh, Dickon,” he said. “If it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He’s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.”

“And he’s trusty,” said Mary. “He’s th’ trustiest lad i’ Yorkshire.” She had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself.

“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.

“I’m learning it as if it was French,” said Mary rather coldly. “It’s like a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. I like it and so does Colin.”

“Well, well,” he said. “If it amuses you perhaps it won’t do you any harm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?”

“No,” Colin answered. “I wouldn’t take it at first and after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low voice—about the spring creeping into a garden.”

“That sounds soothing,” said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking down silently at the carpet. “You are evidently better, but you must remember—”

“I don’t want to remember,” interrupted the Rajah, appearing again. “When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so. If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him brought here.” And he waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies. “It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better.”

Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a “tantrum”; usually he was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things. This afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man.

“Well, sir,” she ventured, “could you have believed it?”

“It is certainly a new state of affairs,” said the doctor. “And there’s no denying it is better than the old one.”

“I believe Susan Sowerby’s right—I do that,” said Mrs. Medlock. “I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of talk with her. And she says to me, ‘Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn’t be a good child, an’ she mayn’t be a pretty one, but she’s a child, an’ children needs children.’ We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and me.”

“She’s the best sick nurse I know,” said Dr. Craven. “When I find her in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.”

Mrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.

“She’s got a way with her, has Susan,” she went on quite volubly. “I’ve been thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday. She says, ‘Once when I was givin’ th’ children a bit of a preach after they’d been fightin’ I ses to ’em all, “When I was at school my jography told as th’ world was shaped like a orange an’ I found out before I was ten that th’ whole orange doesn’t belong to nobody. No one owns more than his bit of a quarter an’ there’s times it seems like there’s not enow quarters to go round. But don’t you—none o’ you—think as you own th’ whole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken, an’ you won’t find it out without hard knocks.” ‘What children learns from children,’ she says, ‘is that there’s no sense in grabbin’ at th’ whole orange—peel an’ all. If you do you’ll likely not get even th’ pips, an’ them’s too bitter to eat.’”

“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.

“Well, she’s got a way of saying things,” ended Mrs. Medlock, much pleased. “Sometimes I’ve said to her, ‘Eh! Susan, if you was a different woman an’ didn’t talk such broad Yorkshire I’ve seen the times when I should have said you was clever.’”

That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his eyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiled because he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to be awake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt as if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let him go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about. And he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute she was in the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.

“You’ve been out! You’ve been out! There’s that nice smell of leaves!” he cried.

She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.

“It’s so beautiful!” she said, a little breathless with her speed. “You never saw anything so beautiful! It has come! I thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come, the Spring! Dickon says so!”

“Has it?” cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it he felt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.

“Open the window!” he added, laughing half with joyful excitement and half at his own fancy. “Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!”

And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds’ songs were pouring through.

“That’s fresh air,” she said. “Lie on your back and draw in long breaths of it. That’s what Dickon does when he’s lying on the moor. He says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if he could live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.”

She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin’s fancy.

“’Forever and ever’! Does it make him feel like that?” he said, and he did as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to him.

Mary was at his bedside again.

“Things are crowding up out of the earth,” she ran on in a hurry. “And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look as wick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.”

And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor. It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk. It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body. Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak. A lamb—a lamb! A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!

She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a little at the sight of the open window. She had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because her patient was sure that open windows gave people cold.

“Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?” she inquired.

“No,” was the answer. “I am breathing long breaths of fresh air. It makes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. My cousin will have breakfast with me.”

The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two breakfasts. She found the servants’ hall a more amusing place than the invalid’s chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from upstairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse who, as the cook said, “had found his master, and good for him.” The servants’ hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his opinion that the invalid would be all the better “for a good hiding.”

When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-like manner.

“A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb, are coming to see me this morning. I want them brought upstairs as soon as they come,” he said. “You are not to begin playing with the animals in the servants’ hall and keep them there. I want them here.”

The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.

“Yes, sir,” she answered.

“I’ll tell you what you can do,” added Colin, waving his hand. “You can tell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha’s brother. His name is Dickon and he is an animal charmer.”

“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the nurse.

“I told you he was a charmer,” said Colin austerely. “Charmers’ animals never bite.”

“There are snake-charmers in India,” said Mary. “And they can put their snakes’ heads in their mouths.”

“Goodness!” shuddered the nurse.

They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them. Colin’s breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with serious interest.

“You will begin to get fatter just as I did,” she said. “I never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.”

“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin. “Perhaps it was the fresh air. When do you think Dickon will come?”

He was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.

“Listen!” she said. “Did you hear a caw?”

Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a house, a hoarse “caw-caw.”

“Yes,” he answered.

“That’s Soot,” said Mary. “Listen again. Do you hear a bleat—a tiny one?”

“Oh, yes!” cried Colin, quite flushing.

“That’s the new-born lamb,” said Mary. “He’s coming.”

Dickon’s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to walk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the long corridors. Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passed through the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin’s own passage.

“If you please, sir,” announced Martha, opening the door, “if you please, sir, here’s Dickon an’ his creatures.”

Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was in his arms and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his left shoulder and Soot on his right and Shell’s head and paws peeped out of his coat pocket.

Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when he first saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truth was that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin had never talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of speaking.

But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not felt embarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only stared and had not spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures were always like that until they found out about you. He walked over to Colin’s sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, and immediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled head with soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could have helped speaking then.

“What is it doing?” cried Colin. “What does it want?”

“It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more. “I brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha’d like to see it feed.”

He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.

“Come on, little ’un,” he said, turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand. “This is what tha’s after. Tha’ll get more out o’ this than tha’ will out o’ silk velvet coats. There now,” and he pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.

After that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb fell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He told them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago. He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in the heights of blue.

“I’d almost lost him but for his song an’ I was wonderin’ how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he’d get out o’ th’ world in a minute—an’ just then I heard somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse bushes. It was a weak bleatin’ an’ I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an’ I knowed it wouldn’t be hungry if it hadn’t lost its mother somehow, so I set off searchin’. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went in an’ out among th’ gorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ I always seemed to take th’ wrong turnin’. But at last I seed a bit o’ white by a rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up an’ found th’ little ’un half dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’.”

While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions into the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches. Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from preference.

They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all the flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing in the secret garden.

“I couldna’ say that there name,” he said, pointing to one under which was written “Aquilegia,” “but us calls that a columbine, an’ that there one it’s a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an’ they’re bigger an’ grander. There’s some big clumps o’ columbine in th’ garden. They’ll look like a bed o’ blue an’ white butterflies flutterin’ when they’re out.”

“I’m going to see them,” cried Colin. “I am going to see them!”

“Aye, that tha’ mun,” said Mary quite seriously. “An’ tha’ munnot lose no time about it.”





CHAPTER XX
“I SHALL LIVE FOREVER—AND EVER—AND EVER!”
But they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came some very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams. The things he had to tell about otters’ and badgers’ and water-rats’ houses, not to mention birds’ nests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working.

“They’re same as us,” said Dickon, “only they have to build their homes every year. An’ it keeps ’em so busy they fair scuffle to get ’em done.”

The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever suspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object to their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about their route. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the “bedding-out plants” the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of war.

Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the invalid’s apartments had of course filtered through the servants’ hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from Master Colin’s room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him.

“Well, well,” he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat, “what’s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn’t to be looked at calling up a man he’s never set eyes on.”

Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpse of the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenest was that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him.

“Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,” said Mrs. Medlock, as she led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened the hitherto mysterious chamber.

“Let’s hope they’re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,” he answered.

“They couldn’t well change for the worse,” she continued; “and queer as it all is there’s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand up under. Don’t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in the middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby’s Dickon more at home than you or me could ever be.”

There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately believed. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently.

“He’d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,” he said. “And yet it’s not impudence, either. He’s just fine, is that lad.”

It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled. When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying “Caw—Caw” quite loudly. In spite of Mrs. Medlock’s warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently undignified to jump backward.

The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. He was sitting in an armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in feeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle. A squirrel was perched on Dickon’s bent back attentively nibbling a nut. The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.

“Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,” said Mrs. Medlock.

The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over—at least that was what the head gardener felt happened.

“Oh, you are Roach, are you?” he said. “I sent for you to give you some very important orders.”

“Very good, sir,” answered Roach, wondering if he was to receive instructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the orchards into water-gardens.

“I am going out in my chair this afternoon,” said Colin. “If the fresh air agrees with me I may go out every day. When I go, none of the gardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. No one is to be there. I shall go out about two o’clock and everyone must keep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.”

“Very good, sir,” replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.

“Mary,” said Colin, turning to her, “what is that thing you say in India when you have finished talking and want people to go?”

“You say, ‘You have my permission to go,’” answered Mary.

The Rajah waved his hand.

“You have my permission to go, Roach,” he said. “But, remember, this is very important.”

“Caw—Caw!” remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.

“Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took him out of the room.

Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smiled until he almost laughed.

“My word!” he said, “he’s got a fine lordly way with him, hasn’t he? You’d think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one—Prince Consort and all.”

“Eh!” protested Mrs. Medlock, “we’ve had to let him trample all over everyone of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that’s what folks was born for.”

“Perhaps he’ll grow out of it, if he lives,” suggested Mr. Roach.

“Well, there’s one thing pretty sure,” said Mrs. Medlock. “If he does live and that Indian child stays here I’ll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. And he’ll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.”

Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.

“It’s all safe now,” he said. “And this afternoon I shall see it—this afternoon I shall be in it!”

Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed with Colin. She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before their lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. She wondered why and asked him about it.

“What big eyes you’ve got, Colin,” she said. “When you are thinking they get as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?”

“I can’t help thinking about what it will look like,” he answered.

“The garden?” asked Mary.

“The springtime,” he said. “I was thinking that I’ve really never seen it before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at it. I didn’t even think about it.”

“I never saw it in India because there wasn’t any,” said Mary.

Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination than she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at wonderful books and pictures.

“That morning when you ran in and said ‘It’s come! It’s come!’, you made me feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a great procession and big bursts and wafts of music. I’ve a picture like it in one of my books—crowds of lovely people and children with garlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and dancing and crowding and playing on pipes. That was why I said, ‘Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets’ and told you to throw open the window.”

“How funny!” said Mary. “That’s really just what it feels like. And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be! I’m sure they’d dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.”

They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but because they both so liked it.

A little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed that instead of lying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some efforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all the time.

“This is one of his good days, sir,” she said to Dr. Craven, who dropped in to inspect him. “He’s in such good spirits that it makes him stronger.”

“I’ll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,” said Dr. Craven. “I must see how the going out agrees with him. I wish,” in a very low voice, “that he would let you go with him.”

“I’d rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here while it’s suggested,” answered the nurse. With sudden firmness.

“I hadn’t really decided to suggest it,” said the doctor, with his slight nervousness. “We’ll try the experiment. Dickon’s a lad I’d trust with a new-born child.”

The strongest footman in the house carried Colin downstairs and put him in his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside. After the manservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his hand to him and to the nurse.

“You have my permission to go,” he said, and they both disappeared quickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside the house.

Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. Mistress Mary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to the sky. The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness. The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strange with a wild clear scented sweetness. Colin kept lifting his thin chest to draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they which were listening—listening, instead of his ears.

“There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,” he said. “What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?”

“It’s gorse on th’ moor that’s openin’ out,” answered Dickon. “Eh! th’ bees are at it wonderful today.”

Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took. In fact every gardener or gardener’s lad had been witched away. But they wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysterious pleasure of it. But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak in whispers.

“This is it,” breathed Mary. “This is where I used to walk up and down and wonder and wonder.”

“Is it?” cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eager curiousness. “But I can see nothing,” he whispered. “There is no door.”

“That’s what I thought,” said Mary.

Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.

“That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,” said Mary.

“Is it?” said Colin.

A few yards more and Mary whispered again.

“This is where the robin flew over the wall,” she said.

“Is it?” cried Colin. “Oh! I wish he’d come again!”

“And that,” said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac bush, “is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me the key.”

Then Colin sat up.

“Where? Where? There?” he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf’s in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on them. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.

“And this,” said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, “is where I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the wall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,” and she took hold of the hanging green curtain.

“Oh! is it—is it!” gasped Colin.

“And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him in—push him in quickly!”

And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.

But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though he gasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and held them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed. Not till then did he take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done. And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all.

“I shall get well! I shall get well!” he cried out. “Mary! Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!”





CHAPTER XXI
BEN WEATHERSTAFF
One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one’s head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one’s heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun—which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in someone’s eyes.

And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt the Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That afternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and crowned everything it possibly could into that one place. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly.

“Eh! it is graidely,” he said. “I’m twelve goin’ on thirteen an’ there’s a lot o’ afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this ’ere.”

“Aye, it is a graidely one,” said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy. “I’ll warrant it’s the graidelest one as ever was in this world.”

“Does tha’ think,” said Colin with dreamy carefulness, “as happen it was made loike this ’ere all o’ purpose for me?”

“My word!” cried Mary admiringly, “that there is a bit o’ good Yorkshire. Tha’rt shapin’ first-rate—that tha’ art.”

And delight reigned.

They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king’s canopy, a fairy king’s. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide. Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes.

Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them. They brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds which were tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It was like being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.

“I wonder if we shall see the robin?” said Colin.

“Tha’ll see him often enow after a bit,” answered Dickon. “When th’ eggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll be kep’ so busy it’ll make his head swim. Tha’ll see him flyin’ backward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms nigh as big as himsel’ an’ that much noise goin’ on in th’ nest when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to drop th’ first piece in. An’ gapin’ beaks an’ squawks on every side. Mother says as when she sees th’ work a robin has to keep them gapin’ beaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin’ to do. She says she’s seen th’ little chaps when it seemed like th’ sweat must be droppin’ off ’em, though folk can’t see it.”

This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard. Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper.

Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the sunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back under the canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.

“That’s a very old tree over there, isn’t it?” he said.

Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there was a brief moment of stillness.

“Yes,” answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentle sound.

Mary gazed at the tree and thought.

“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single leaf anywhere,” Colin went on. “It’s quite dead, isn’t it?”

“Aye,” admitted Dickon. “But them roses as has climbed all over it will near hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood when they’re full o’ leaves an’ flowers. It won’t look dead then. It’ll be th’ prettiest of all.”

Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.

“It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,” said Colin. “I wonder how it was done.”

“It’s been done many a year,” answered Dickon. “Eh!” with a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on Colin. “Look at that robin! There he is! He’s been foragin’ for his mate.”

Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through the greenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin leaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.

“He’s taking her tea to her. Perhaps it’s five o’clock. I think I’d like some tea myself.”

And so they were safe.

“It was Magic which sent the robin,” said Mary secretly to Dickon afterward. “I know it was Magic.” For both she and Dickon had been afraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had stood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.

“We mun look as if it wasn’t no different from th’ other trees,” he had said. “We couldn’t never tell him how it broke, poor lad. If he says anything about it we mun—we mun try to look cheerful.”

“Aye, that we mun,” had answered Mary.

But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree. She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes.

“Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,” he had gone on rather hesitatingly. “An’ mother she thinks maybe she’s about Misselthwaite many a time lookin’ after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when they’re took out o’ th’ world. They have to come back, tha’ sees. Happen she’s been in the garden an’ happen it was her set us to work, an’ told us to bring him here.”

Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a great believer in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend. She wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question. She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy. It did not seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change. The faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died away. He looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.

They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it was so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.

“Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the rhododendron walk,” he said. “And then you and Dickon can bring it here.”

It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.

The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour. The sun was deepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds were flying past less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural color.

“I don’t want this afternoon to go,” he said; “but I shall come back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.”

“You’ll get plenty of fresh air, won’t you?” said Mary.

“I’m going to get nothing else,” he answered. “I’ve seen the spring now and I’m going to see the summer. I’m going to see everything grow here. I’m going to grow here myself.”

“That tha’ will,” said Dickon. “Us’ll have thee walkin’ about here an’ diggin’ same as other folk afore long.”

Colin flushed tremendously.

“Walk!” he said. “Dig! Shall I?”

Dickon’s glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary had ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs.

“For sure tha’ will,” he said stoutly. “Tha—tha’s got legs o’ thine own, same as other folks!”

Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin’s answer.

“Nothing really ails them,” he said, “but they are so thin and weak. They shake so that I’m afraid to try to stand on them.”

Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.

“When tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand on ’em,” Dickon said with renewed cheer. “An’ tha’lt stop bein’ afraid in a bit.”

“I shall?” said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering about things.

They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping lower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really had had a busy and exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he were resting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his eyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute.

In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half lifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:

“Who is that man?”

Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.

“Man!” they both cried in low quick voices.

Colin pointed to the high wall.

“Look!” he whispered excitedly. “Just look!”

Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff’s indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder! He actually shook his fist at Mary.

“If I wasn’t a bachelder, an’ tha’ was a wench o’ mine,” he cried, “I’d give thee a hidin’!”

He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic intention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him he evidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder shaking his fist down at her.

“I never thowt much o’ thee!” he harangued. “I couldna’ abide thee th’ first time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin’ questions an’ pokin’ tha’ nose where it wasna, wanted. I never knowed how tha’ got so thick wi’ me. If it hadna’ been for th’ robin— Drat him—”

“Ben Weatherstaff,” called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood below him and called up to him with a sort of gasp. “Ben Weatherstaff, it was the robin who showed me the way!”

Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of the wall, he was so outraged.

“Tha’ young bad ’un!” he called down at her. “Layin’ tha’ badness on a robin—not but what he’s impidint enow for anythin’. Him showin’ thee th’ way! Him! Eh! tha’ young nowt”—she could see his next words burst out because he was overpowered by curiosity—“however i’ this world did tha’ get in?”

“It was the robin who showed me the way,” she protested obstinately. “He didn’t know he was doing it but he did. And I can’t tell you from here while you’re shaking your fist at me.”

He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his jaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw coming over the grass toward him.

At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised that he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in the midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon.

“Wheel me over there!” he commanded. “Wheel me quite close and stop right in front of him!”

And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which made his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him. And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff’s nose. It was really no wonder his mouth dropped open.

“Do you know who I am?” demanded the Rajah.

How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed and gulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.

“Do you know who I am?” demanded Colin still more imperiously. “Answer!”

Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes and over his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.

“Who tha’ art?” he said. “Aye, that I do—wi’ tha’ mother’s eyes starin’ at me out o’ tha’ face. Lord knows how tha’ come here. But tha’rt th’ poor cripple.”

Colin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet and he sat bolt upright.

“I’m not a cripple!” he cried out furiously. “I’m not!”

“He’s not!” cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierce indignation. “He’s not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked and there was none there—not one!”

Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as if he could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he could only remember the things he had heard.

“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got a crooked back?” he said hoarsely.

“No!” shouted Colin.

“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs?” quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.

It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into his tantrums rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he been accused of crooked legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simple belief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff’s voice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and insulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength.

“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. “Come here! Come here! This minute!”

Dickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a short gasp and felt herself turn pale.

“He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!” she gabbled over to herself under her breath as fast as ever she could.

There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground, Dickon held Colin’s arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on the grass. Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight as an arrow and looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and his strange eyes flashing lightning.

“Look at me!” he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. “Just look at me—you! Just look at me!”

“He’s as straight as I am!” cried Dickon. “He’s as straight as any lad i’ Yorkshire!”

What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He choked and gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as he struck his old hands together.

“Eh!” he burst forth, “th’ lies folk tells! Tha’rt as thin as a lath an’ as white as a wraith, but there’s not a knob on thee. Tha’lt make a mon yet. God bless thee!”

Dickon held Colin’s arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter. He stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face.

“I’m your master,” he said, “when my father is away. And you are to obey me. This is my garden. Don’t dare to say a word about it! You get down from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet you and bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want you, but now you will have to be in the secret. Be quick!”

Ben Weatherstaff’s crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer rush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.

“Eh! lad,” he almost whispered. “Eh! my lad!” And then remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, “Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder.





CHAPTER XXII
WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN
When his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.

“Go and meet him,” he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door under the ivy.

Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet spots on his cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.

“I can stand,” he said, and his head was still held up and he said it quite grandly.

“I told thee tha’ could as soon as tha’ stopped bein’ afraid,” answered Dickon. “An’ tha’s stopped.”

“Yes, I’ve stopped,” said Colin.

Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.

“Are you making Magic?” he asked sharply.

Dickon’s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.

“Tha’s doin’ Magic thysel’,” he said. “It’s same Magic as made these ’ere work out o’ th’ earth,” and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses in the grass.

Colin looked down at them.

“Aye,” he said slowly, “there couldna’ be bigger Magic than that there—there couldna’ be.”

He drew himself up straighter than ever.

“I’m going to walk to that tree,” he said, pointing to one a few feet away from him. “I’m going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here. I can rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will sit down, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.”

He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully steady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall.

When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.

“What art sayin’?” he asked rather testily because he did not want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud face.

But she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:

“You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You can do it! You can!”

She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness. He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.

“Look at me!” he commanded. “Look at me all over! Am I a hunchback? Have I got crooked legs?”

Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had recovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.

“Not tha’,” he said. “Nowt o’ th’ sort. What’s tha’ been doin’ with thysel’—hidin’ out o’ sight an’ lettin’ folk think tha’ was cripple an’ half-witted?”

“Half-witted!” said Colin angrily. “Who thought that?”

“Lots o’ fools,” said Ben. “Th’ world’s full o’ jackasses brayin’ an’ they never bray nowt but lies. What did tha’ shut thysel’ up for?”

“Everyone thought I was going to die,” said Colin shortly. “I’m not!”

And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up and down, down and up.

“Tha’ die!” he said with dry exultation. “Nowt o’ th’ sort! Tha’s got too much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put tha’ legs on th’ ground in such a hurry I knowed tha’ was all right. Sit thee down on th’ rug a bit young Mester an’ give me thy orders.”

There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well—getting well. The garden was doing it. No one must let him remember about having humps and dying.

The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.

“What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?” he inquired.

“Anythin’ I’m told to do,” answered old Ben. “I’m kep’ on by favor—because she liked me.”

“She?” said Colin.

“Tha’ mother,” answered Ben Weatherstaff.

“My mother?” said Colin, and he looked about him quietly. “This was her garden, wasn’t it?”

“Aye, it was that!” and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too. “She were main fond of it.”

“It is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,” announced Colin. “But it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one is to know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made it come alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must come when no one can see you.”

Ben Weatherstaff’s face twisted itself in a dry old smile.

“I’ve come here before when no one saw me,” he said.

“What!” exclaimed Colin. “When?”

“Th’ last time I was here,” rubbing his chin and looking round, “was about two year’ ago.”

“But no one has been in it for ten years!” cried Colin.

“There was no door!”

“I’m no one,” said old Ben dryly. “An’ I didn’t come through th’ door. I come over th’ wall. Th’ rheumatics held me back th’ last two year’.”

“Tha’ come an’ did a bit o’ prunin’!” cried Dickon. “I couldn’t make out how it had been done.”

“She was so fond of it—she was!” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. “An’ she was such a pretty young thing. She says to me once, ‘Ben,’ says she laughin’, ‘if ever I’m ill or if I go away you must take care of my roses.’ When she did go away th’ orders was no one was ever to come nigh. But I come,” with grumpy obstinacy. “Over th’ wall I come—until th’ rheumatics stopped me—an’ I did a bit o’ work once a year. She’d gave her order first.”

“It wouldn’t have been as wick as it is if tha’ hadn’t done it,” said Dickon. “I did wonder.”

“I’m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,” said Colin. “You’ll know how to keep the secret.”

“Aye, I’ll know, sir,” answered Ben. “An’ it’ll be easier for a man wi’ rheumatics to come in at th’ door.”

On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretched out his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.

“You can do it! You can do it!” said Mary to herself. “I tell you, you can!”

Dickon’s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a word. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.

Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.

“Tha’ said as tha’d have me walkin’ about here same as other folk—an’ tha’ said tha’d have me diggin’. I thowt tha’ was just leein’ to please me. This is only th’ first day an’ I’ve walked—an’ here I am diggin’.”

Ben Weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he ended by chuckling.

“Eh!” he said, “that sounds as if tha’d got wits enow. Tha’rt a Yorkshire lad for sure. An’ tha’rt diggin’, too. How’d tha’ like to plant a bit o’ somethin’? I can get thee a rose in a pot.”

“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly. “Quick! Quick!”

It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over. He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.

“I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,” he said.

Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begun to be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.

“Here, lad,” he said, handing the plant to Colin. “Set it in the earth thysel’ same as th’ king does when he goes to a new place.”

The thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth. It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was leaning forward on her hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.

“It’s planted!” said Colin at last. “And the sun is only slipping over the edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes. That’s part of the Magic.”

And Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave him strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two feet—laughing.





CHAPTER XXIII
MAGIC
Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it. He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send someone out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to his room the poor man looked him over seriously.

“You should not have stayed so long,” he said. “You must not overexert yourself.”

“I am not tired at all,” said Colin. “It has made me well. Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.”

“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven. “I am afraid it would not be wise.”

“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin quite seriously. “I am going.”

Even Mary had found out that one of Colin’s chief peculiarities was that he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with his way of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind which is usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and looked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.

“What are you looking at me for?” he said.

“I’m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”

“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some satisfaction. “He won’t get Misselthwaite at all now I’m not going to die.”

“I’m sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary, “but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never have done it.”

“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly.

“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,” said Mary, “he would have slapped you.”

“But he daren’t,” said Colin.

“No, he daren’t,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite without prejudice. “Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn’t like—because you were going to die and things like that. You were such a poor thing.”

“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going to be a poor thing. I won’t let people think I’m one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.”

“It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,” Mary went on, thinking aloud.

Colin turned his head, frowning.

“Am I queer?” he demanded.

“Yes,” answered Mary, “very. But you needn’t be cross,” she added impartially, “because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I found the garden.”

“I don’t want to be queer,” said Colin. “I am not going to be,” and he frowned again with determination.

He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.

“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day to the garden. There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure there is.”

“So am I,” said Mary.

“Even if it isn’t real Magic,” Colin said, “we can pretend it is. Something is there—something!”

“It’s Magic,” said Mary, “but not black. It’s as white as snow.”

They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing ones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never had a garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there. At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things to grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.

“She was main fond o’ them—she was,” Ben Weatherstaff said. “She liked them things as was allus pointin’ up to th’ blue sky, she used to tell. Not as she was one o’ them as looked down on th’ earth—not her. She just loved it but she said as th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful.”

The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there. And the roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour. Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden air.

Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morning he was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn’t rain he spent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on the grass “watching things growing,” he said. If you watched long enough, he declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could make the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country. A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants’ ways, beetles’ ways, bees’ ways, frogs’ ways, birds’ ways, plants’ ways, gave him a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes’ ways, otters’ ways, ferrets’ ways, squirrels’ ways, and trout’ and water-rats’ and badgers’ ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.

And this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really once stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of it greatly. He talked of it constantly.

“Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,” he said wisely one day, “but people don’t know what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.”

The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once for Ben Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the Rajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also very beautifully smiling.

“Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,” he said. “I want you and Dickon and Miss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell you something very important.”

“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (One of the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his boyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could reply like a sailor.)

“I am going to try a scientific experiment,” explained the Rajah. “When I grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am going to begin now with this experiment.”

“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the first time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.

It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read about a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old—going on eleven. At this moment he was especially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.

“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,” he went on, “will be about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely anyone knows anything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little, because she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickon knows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn’t know he knows it. He charms animals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—like electricity and horses and steam.”

This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and really could not keep still.

“Aye, aye, sir,” he said and he began to stand up quite straight.

“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,” the orator proceeded. “Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and making things out of nothing. One day things weren’t there and another they were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific. I keep saying to myself, ‘What is it? What is it?’ It’s something. It can’t be nothing! I don’t know its name so I call it Magic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it up and draws it. Sometimes since I’ve been in the garden I’ve looked up through the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be all around us. In this garden—in all the places. The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man. I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I don’t know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it perhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as she could, ‘You can do it! You can do it!’ and I did. I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—and so did Dickon’s. Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, ‘Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!’ And you must all do it, too. That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?”

“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff. “Aye, aye!”

“If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through drill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment succeeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking about them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be the same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help you it will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.”

“I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs who said words over and over thousands of times,” said Mary.

“I’ve heard Jem Fettleworth’s wife say th’ same thing over thousands o’ times—callin’ Jem a drunken brute,” said Ben Weatherstaff dryly. “Summat allus come o’ that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin’ an’ went to th’ Blue Lion an’ got as drunk as a lord.”

Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he cheered up.

“Well,” he said, “you see something did come of it. She used the wrong Magic until she made him beat her. If she’d used the right Magic and had said something nice perhaps he wouldn’t have got as drunk as a lord and perhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.”

Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little old eyes.

“Tha’rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,” he said. “Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I’ll give her a bit of a hint o’ what Magic will do for her. She’d be rare an’ pleased if th’ sinetifik ’speriment worked—an’ so ’ud Jem.”

Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with curious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.

“Do you think the experiment will work?” Colin asked him, wondering what he was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when he saw him looking at him or at one of his “creatures” with his happy wide smile.

He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.

“Aye,” he answered, “that I do. It’ll work same as th’ seeds do when th’ sun shines on ’em. It’ll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?”

Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirs and devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit cross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.

“It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,” said Colin. “I’m rather tired and I want to sit down.”

“Eh!” said Dickon, “tha’ mustn’t begin by sayin’ tha’rt tired. Tha’ might spoil th’ Magic.”

Colin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes.

“That’s true,” he said slowly. “I must only think of the Magic.”

It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their circle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into appearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in being what he called “agen’ prayer-meetin’s” but this being the Rajah’s affair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at being called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured. Dickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer’s signal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their own desire.

“The ‘creatures’ have come,” said Colin gravely. “They want to help us.”

Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head high as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderful look in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.

“Now we will begin,” he said. “Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary, as if we were dervishes?”

“I canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard and for’ard,” said Ben Weatherstaff. “I’ve got th’ rheumatics.”

“The Magic will take them away,” said Colin in a High Priest tone, “but we won’t sway until it has done it. We will only chant.”

“I canna’ do no chantin’” said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. “They turned me out o’ th’ church choir th’ only time I ever tried it.”

No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin’s face was not even crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.

“Then I will chant,” he said. And he began, looking like a strange boy spirit. “The sun is shining—the sun is shining. That is the Magic. The flowers are growing—the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being alive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me—the Magic is in me. It is in me—it is in me. It’s in everyone of us. It’s in Ben Weatherstaff’s back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!”

He said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodly number. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queer and beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff began to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. The humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb’s back. Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.

“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced.

Ben Weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a jerk.

“You have been asleep,” said Colin.

“Nowt o’ th’ sort,” mumbled Ben. “Th’ sermon was good enow—but I’m bound to get out afore th’ collection.”

He was not quite awake yet.

“You’re not in church,” said Colin.

“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself. “Who said I were? I heard every bit of it. You said th’ Magic was in my back. Th’ doctor calls it rheumatics.”

The Rajah waved his hand.

“That was the wrong Magic,” he said. “You will get better. You have my permission to go to your work. But come back tomorrow.”

“I’d like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben.

It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being a stubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up his mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling.

The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head with Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.

It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few yards it stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon’s arm and privately Ben Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his hand from its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held up all the time and he looked very grand.

“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying. “The Magic is making me strong! I can feel it! I can feel it!”

It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him. He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on the grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When he returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant.

“I did it! The Magic worked!” he cried. “That is my first scientific discovery.”

“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary.

“He won’t say anything,” Colin answered, “because he will not be told. This is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any other boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in it. I won’t have people whispering and asking questions and I won’t let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study and say ‘Here I am; I am like any other boy. I am quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by a scientific experiment.’”

“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary. “He won’t believe his eyes.”

Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he was going to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he had been aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers’ sons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him.

“He’ll be obliged to believe them,” he said.

“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.”

“We shall have thee takin’ to boxin’ in a week or so,” said Ben Weatherstaff. “Tha’lt end wi’ winnin’ th’ Belt an’ bein’ champion prize-fighter of all England.”

Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.

“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful. You must not take liberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I shall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”

“Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his forehead in salute. “I ought to have seed it wasn’t a jokin’ matter,” but his eyes twinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strength and spirit.





CHAPTER XXIV
“LET THEM LAUGH”
The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother. In the company of his “creatures” he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.

“We’d never get on as comfortable as we do,” Mrs. Sowerby said, “if it wasn’t for Dickon’s garden. Anything’ll grow for him. His ’taters and cabbages is twice th’ size of anyone else’s an’ they’ve got a flavor with ’em as nobody’s has.”

When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him. After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not only vegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.

“All a chap’s got to do to make ’em thrive, mother,” he would say, “is to be friends with ’em for sure. They’re just like th’ ‘creatures.’ If they’re thirsty give ’em drink and if they’re hungry give ’em a bit o’ food. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if I’d been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.”

It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that “Mester Colin” had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon’s mother might “come into the secret.” Somehow it was not doubted that she was “safe for sure.”

So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff’s angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin’s sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby’s nice-looking face quite change color several times.

“My word!” she said. “It was a good thing that little lass came to th’ Manor. It’s been th’ makin’ o’ her an’ th’ savin, o’ him. Standin’ on his feet! An’ us all thinkin’ he was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him.”

She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep thinking.

“What do they make of it at th’ Manor—him being so well an’ cheerful an’ never complainin’?” she inquired.

“They don’t know what to make of it,” answered Dickon. “Every day as comes round his face looks different. It’s fillin’ out and doesn’t look so sharp an’ th’ waxy color is goin’. But he has to do his bit o’ complainin’,” with a highly entertained grin.

“What for, i’ Mercy’s name?” asked Mrs. Sowerby.

Dickon chuckled.

“He does it to keep them from guessin’ what’s happened. If the doctor knew he’d found out he could stand on his feet he’d likely write and tell Mester Craven. Mester Colin’s savin’ th’ secret to tell himself. He’s goin’ to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father comes back an’ then he’s goin’ to march into his room an’ show him he’s as straight as other lads. But him an’ Miss Mary thinks it’s best plan to do a bit o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then to throw folk off th’ scent.”

Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished his last sentence.

“Eh!” she said, “that pair’s enjoyin’ theirselves I’ll warrant. They’ll get a good bit o’ actin’ out of it an’ there’s nothin’ children likes as much as play actin’. Let’s hear what they do, Dickon lad.”

Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyes were twinkling with fun.

“Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,” he explained. “An’ he flies out at John, th’ footman, for not carryin’ him careful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin’ as he can an’ never lifts his head until we’re out o’ sight o’ th’ house. An’ he grunts an’ frets a good bit when he’s bein’ settled into his chair. Him an’ Miss Mary’s both got to enjoyin’ it an’ when he groans an’ complains she’ll say, ‘Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?’—but th’ trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin’ out laughin’. When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they’ve no breath left to laugh with. An’ they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin’s cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin’, if any of, ’em’s about.”

“Th’ more they laugh th’ better for ’em!” said Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself. “Good healthy child laughin’s better than pills any day o’ th’ year. That pair’ll plump up for sure.”

“They are plumpin’ up,” said Dickon. “They’re that hungry they don’t know how to get enough to eat without makin’ talk. Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin’ for more food they won’t believe he’s an invalid at all. Miss Mary says she’ll let him eat her share, but he says that if she goes hungry she’ll get thin an’ they mun both get fat at once.”

Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her.

“I’ll tell thee what, lad,” Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak. “I’ve thought of a way to help ’em. When tha’ goes to ’em in th’ mornin’s tha’ shall take a pail o’ good new milk an’ I’ll bake ’em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi’ currants in ’em, same as you children like. Nothin’s so good as fresh milk an’ bread. Then they could take off th’ edge o’ their hunger while they were in their garden an’ th, fine food they get indoors ’ud polish off th’ corners.”

“Eh! mother!” said Dickon admiringly, “what a wonder tha’ art! Tha’ always sees a way out o’ things. They was quite in a pother yesterday. They didn’t see how they was to manage without orderin’ up more food—they felt that empty inside.”

“They’re two young ’uns growin’ fast, an’ health’s comin’ back to both of ’em. Children like that feels like young wolves an’ food’s flesh an’ blood to ’em,” said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon’s own curving smile. “Eh! but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves for sure,” she said.

She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and she had never been more so than when she said their “play actin’” would be their joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr. Craven himself.

“Your appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,” the nurse had said one day. “You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed with you.”

“Nothing disagrees with me now” replied Colin, and then seeing the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet. “At least things don’t so often disagree with me. It’s the fresh air.”

“Perhaps it is,” said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified expression. “But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.”

“How she stared at you!” said Mary when she went away. “As if she thought there must be something to find out.”

“I won’t have her finding out things,” said Colin. “No one must begin to find out yet.”

When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a number of questions, to Colin’s great annoyance.

“You stay out in the garden a great deal,” he suggested. “Where do you go?”

Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.

“I will not let anyone know where I go,” he answered. “I go to a place I like. Everyone has orders to keep out of the way. I won’t be watched and stared at. You know that!”

“You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm—I do not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before.”

“Perhaps,” said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, “perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.”

“I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,” said Dr. Craven. “You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.”

“Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,” said Colin, assuming a discouraging air of gloom. “People who are not going to live are often—different.”

Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin’s wrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm.

“You are not feverish,” he said thoughtfully, “and such flesh as you have gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying. Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.”

“I won’t have him told!” Colin broke forth fiercely. “It will only disappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get worse this very night. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now. I won’t have letters written to my father—I won’t—I won’t! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feel hot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!”

“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him. “Nothing shall be written without your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You must not undo the good which has been done.”

He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse he privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient.

“The boy is extraordinarily better,” he said. “His advance seems almost abnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him.”

Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From this time dated their plan of “play actin’.”

“I may be obliged to have a tantrum,” said Colin regretfully. “I don’t want to have one and I’m not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one. Perhaps I couldn’t have one at all. That lump doesn’t come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something.”

He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table—particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover—they would look into each other’s eyes in desperation.

“I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,” Colin always ended by saying. “We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner.”

But they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment.

“I do wish,” Colin would say also, “I do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for anyone.”

“It’s enough for a person who is going to die,” answered Mary when first she heard this, “but it’s not enough for a person who is going to live. I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.”

The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours—went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness. What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, clever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious fresh milk!

“Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,” said Colin. “It makes her think of ways to do things—nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell her we are grateful, Dickon—extremely grateful.”

He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed them. He liked this so much that he improved upon it.

“Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.”

And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.

This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind. They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.

Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king—besides being deliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.

Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger—as well it might. He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.

“Yesterday,” he said one morning after an absence, “I went to Thwaite for mother an’ near th’ Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He’s the strongest chap on th’ moor. He’s the champion wrestler an’ he can jump higher than any other chap an’ throw th’ hammer farther. He’s gone all th’ way to Scotland for th’ sports some years. He’s knowed me ever since I was a little ’un an’ he’s a friendly sort an’ I axed him some questions. Th’ gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o’ thee, Mester Colin, and I says, ‘How did tha’ make tha’ muscles stick out that way, Bob? Did tha’ do anythin’ extra to make thysel’ so strong?’ An’ he says ‘Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an’ legs an’ every muscle in my body. An’ I says, ‘Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with ’em, Bob?’ an’ he laughed an’ says, ‘Art tha’ th’ delicate chap?’ an’ I says, ‘No, but I knows a young gentleman that’s gettin’ well of a long illness an’ I wish I knowed some o’ them tricks to tell him about.’ I didn’t say no names an’ he didn’t ask none. He’s friendly same as I said an’ he stood up an’ showed me good-natured like, an’ I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart.”

Colin had been listening excitedly.

“Can you show me?” he cried. “Will you?”

“Aye, to be sure,” Dickon answered, getting up. “But he says tha’ mun do ’em gentle at first an’ be careful not to tire thysel’. Rest in between times an’ take deep breaths an’ don’t overdo.”

“I’ll be careful,” said Colin. “Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are the most Magic boy in the world!”

Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them with widening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too.

From that time the exercises were part of the day’s duties as much as the Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby’s bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.

“They are eating next to nothing,” said the nurse. “They’ll die of starvation if they can’t be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yet see how they look.”

“Look!” exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. “Eh! I’m moithered to death with them. They’re a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday—and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them—and back it’s sent. She almost cried. She’s afraid she’ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves.”

Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at—but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin’s sofa and examined him. He had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were fuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over.

“I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,” he said. “That will not do. You will lose all you have gained—and you have gained amazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.”

“I told you it was an unnatural appetite,” answered Colin.

Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer sound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost choking.

“What is the matter?” said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.

Mary became quite severe in her manner.

“It was something between a sneeze and a cough,” she replied with reproachful dignity, “and it got into my throat.”

“But,” she said afterward to Colin, “I couldn’t stop myself. It just burst out because all at once I couldn’t help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.”

“Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?” Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.

“There’s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “They stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to eat from what’s sent up to them they need only ask for it.”

“Well,” said Dr. Craven, “so long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.”

“So is the girl,” said Mrs. Medlock. “She’s begun to be downright pretty since she’s filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her hair’s grown thick and healthy looking and she’s got a bright color. The glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps they’re growing fat on that.”

“Perhaps they are,” said Dr. Craven. “Let them laugh.”





CHAPTER XXV
THE CURTAIN
And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles. In the robin’s nest there were Eggs and the robin’s mate sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful wings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like themselves—nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what was happening to them—the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and crash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one who did not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his mate knew they knew it.

At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For some mysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment he set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin (which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other). To speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough to understand feathered speech. His movements also were robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not even disturbing.

But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then when he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him. The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on one side and then on the other. He thought that the slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly. The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.

When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an immense relief. But for a long time—or it seemed a long time to the robin—he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the other humans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again.

One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He had taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest. So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly—or rather to walk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her nest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and learn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.

After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of the children at times did unusual things. They would stand under the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They went through these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do. He could only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied (atrophied means wasted away through want of use).

When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that your Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs’ mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.

But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull. One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.

“Now that I am a real boy,” Colin had said, “my legs and arms and all my body are so full of Magic that I can’t keep them still. They want to be doing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in the morning, Mary, when it’s quite early and the birds are just shouting outside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees and things we can’t really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed and shout myself. If I did it, just think what would happen!”

Mary giggled inordinately.

“The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and they would be sure you had gone crazy and they’d send for the doctor,” she said.

Colin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look—how horrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.

“I wish my father would come home,” he said. “I want to tell him myself. I’m always thinking about it—but we couldn’t go on like this much longer. I can’t stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look too different. I wish it wasn’t raining today.”

It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.

“Colin,” she began mysteriously, “do you know how many rooms there are in this house?”

“About a thousand, I suppose,” he answered.

“There’s about a hundred no one ever goes into,” said Mary. “And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I was coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was the second time I heard you crying.”

Colin started up on his sofa.

“A hundred rooms no one goes into,” he said. “It sounds almost like a secret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. Wheel me in my chair and nobody would know we went.”

“That’s what I was thinking,” said Mary. “No one would dare to follow us. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our exercises. There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory elephants. There are all sorts of rooms.”

“Ring the bell,” said Colin.

When the nurse came in he gave his orders.

“I want my chair,” he said. “Miss Mary and I are going to look at the part of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as the picture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away and leave us alone until I send for him again.”

Rainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had wheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in obedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. As soon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.

“I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,” he said, “and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth’s exercises.”

And they did all these things and many others. They looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger.

“All these,” said Colin, “must be my relations. They lived a long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, great aunts. She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as you looked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and better looking.”

“So are you,” said Mary, and they both laughed.

They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of. It was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles away from them was a fascinating thing.

“I’m glad we came,” Colin said. “I never knew I lived in such a big queer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day. We shall always be finding new queer corners and things.”

That morning they had found among other things such good appetites that when they returned to Colin’s room it was not possible to send the luncheon away untouched.

When the nurse carried the tray downstairs she slapped it down on the kitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly polished dishes and plates.

“Look at that!” she said. “This is a house of mystery, and those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.”

“If they keep that up every day,” said the strong young footman John, “there’d be small wonder that he weighs twice as much today as he did a month ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing my muscles an injury.”

That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin’s room. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she thought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothing today but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel. She could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. That was the change she noticed.

“I know what you want me to tell you,” said Colin, after she had stared a few minutes. “I always know when you want me to tell you something. You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep it like that.”

“Why?” asked Mary.

“Because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing. I wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn’t lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room was quite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. It made me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that all the time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.”

“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I think perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.”

That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answered her slowly.

“If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me,” he said.

“Do you want him to be fond of you?” inquired Mary.

“I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me I think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more cheerful.”





CHAPTER XXVI
“IT’S MOTHER!”
Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After the morning’s incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.

“I like to do it,” he explained, “because when I grow up and make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so this is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am very young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he would go to sleep.”

“Th’ best thing about lecturin’,” said Ben, “is that a chap can get up an’ say aught he pleases an’ no other chap can answer him back. I wouldn’t be agen’ lecturin’ a bit mysel’ sometimes.”

But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection. It was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben’s earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.

“What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?” he asked.

“I was thinkin’” answered Ben, “as I’d warrant tha’s gone up three or four pound this week. I was lookin’ at tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders. I’d like to get thee on a pair o’ scales.”

“It’s the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby’s buns and milk and things,” said Colin. “You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.”

That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was as good at weeding as anyone in these days and he could lecture while he was doing it.

“The Magic works best when you work, yourself,” he said this morning. “You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I am making it up now. I keep finding out things.”

It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did. When he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly. Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness. All at once he had realized something to the full.

“Mary! Dickon!” he cried. “Just look at me!”

They stopped their weeding and looked at him.

“Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?” he demanded.

Dickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he could see more things than most people could and many of them were things he never talked about. He saw some of them now in this boy.

“Aye, that we do,” he answered.

Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.

“Just this minute,” said Colin, “all at once I remembered it myself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had to stand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I’m well—I’m well!”

“Aye, that th’ art!” said Dickon.

“I’m well! I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face went quite red all over.

He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and thought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all through him—a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been so strong that he could not help calling out.

“I shall live forever and ever and ever!” he cried grandly. “I shall find out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out about people and creatures and everything that grows—like Dickon—and I shall never stop making Magic. I’m well! I’m well! I feel—I feel as if I want to shout out something—something thankful, joyful!”

Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him.

“Tha’ might sing th’ Doxology,” he suggested in his dryest grunt. He had no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with any particular reverence.

But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the Doxology.

“What is that?” he inquired.

“Dickon can sing it for thee, I’ll warrant,” replied Ben Weatherstaff.

Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer’s smile.

“They sing it i’ church,” he said. “Mother says she believes th’ skylarks sings it when they gets up i’ th’ mornin’.”

“If she says that, it must be a nice song,” Colin answered. “I’ve never been in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I want to hear it.”

Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood what Colin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort of instinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding. He pulled off his cap and looked round still smiling.

“Tha’ must take off tha’ cap,” he said to Colin, “an’ so mun tha’, Ben—an’ tha’ mun stand up, tha’ knows.”

Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair as he watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his knees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his old face as if he didn’t know exactly why he was doing this remarkable thing.

Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in quite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:

“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
            Amen.”
When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with his jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on Colin. Colin’s face was thoughtful and appreciative.

“It is a very nice song,” he said. “I like it. Perhaps it means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.” He stopped and thought in a puzzled way. “Perhaps they are both the same thing. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it again, Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It’s my song. How does it begin? ‘Praise God from whom all blessings flow’?”

And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as musically as they could and Dickon’s swelled quite loud and beautiful—and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his throat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the “Amen” came to an end Mary observed that the very same thing had happened to him which had happened when he found out that Colin was not a cripple—his chin was twitching and he was staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.

“I never seed no sense in th’ Doxology afore,” he said hoarsely, “but I may change my mind i’ time. I should say tha’d gone up five pound this week Mester Colin—five on ’em!”

Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his attention and his expression had become a startled one.

“Who is coming in here?” he said quickly. “Who is it?”

The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered. She had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin’s books. She had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in—all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the “creatures” and every flower that was in bloom. Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt that she was an intruder at all. Dickon’s eyes lighted like lamps.

“It’s mother—that’s who it is!” he cried and went across the grass at a run.

Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They both felt their pulses beat faster.

“It’s mother!” Dickon said again when they met halfway. “I knowed tha’ wanted to see her an’ I told her where th’ door was hid.”

Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his eyes quite devoured her face.

“Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,” he said, “you and Dickon and the secret garden. I’d never wanted to see anyone or anything before.”

The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own. She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her eyes.

“Eh! dear lad!” she broke out tremulously. “Eh! dear lad!” as if she had not known she were going to say it. She did not say, “Mester Colin,” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly. She might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her. Colin liked it.

“Are you surprised because I am so well?” he asked.

She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.

“Aye, that I am!” she said; “but tha’rt so like thy mother tha’ made my heart jump.”

“Do you think,” said Colin a little awkwardly, “that will make my father like me?”

“Aye, for sure, dear lad,” she answered and she gave his shoulder a soft quick pat. “He mun come home—he mun come home.”

“Susan Sowerby,” said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. “Look at th’ lad’s legs, wilt tha’? They was like drumsticks i’ stockin’ two month’ ago—an’ I heard folk tell as they was bandy an’ knock-kneed both at th’ same time. Look at ’em now!”

Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.

“They’re goin’ to be fine strong lad’s legs in a bit,” she said. “Let him go on playin’ an’ workin’ in the garden an’ eatin’ hearty an’ drinkin’ plenty o’ good sweet milk an’ there’ll not be a finer pair i’ Yorkshire, thank God for it.”

She put both hands on Mistress Mary’s shoulders and looked her little face over in a motherly fashion.

“An’ thee, too!” she said. “Tha’rt grown near as hearty as our ’Lisabeth Ellen. I’ll warrant tha’rt like thy mother too. Our Martha told me as Mrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman. Tha’lt be like a blush rose when tha’ grows up, my little lass, bless thee.”

She did not mention that when Martha came home on her “day out” and described the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. “It doesn’t stand to reason that a pretty woman could be th’ mother o’ such a fou’ little lass,” she had added obstinately.

Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. She had only known that she looked “different” and seemed to have a great deal more hair and that it was growing very fast. But remembering her pleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hear that she might some day look like her.

Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colin walked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them—a sort of warm, supported feeling. It seemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his “creatures.” She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon’s. When they told her about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat.

“I suppose learnin’ ’em to fly is like learnin’ children to walk, but I’m feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o’ legs,” she said.

It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland cottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.

“Do you believe in Magic?” asked Colin after he had explained about Indian fakirs. “I do hope you do.”

“That I do, lad,” she answered. “I never knowed it by that name but what does th’ name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i’ France an’ a different one i’ Germany. Th’ same thing as set th’ seeds swellin’ an’ th’ sun shinin’ made thee a well lad an’ it’s th’ Good Thing. It isn’t like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of our names. Th’ Big Good Thing doesn’t stop to worrit, bless thee. It goes on makin’ worlds by th’ million—worlds like us. Never thee stop believin’ in th’ Big Good Thing an’ knowin’ th’ world’s full of it—an’ call it what tha’ likes. Tha’ wert singin’ to it when I come into th’ garden.”

“I felt so joyful,” said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes at her. “Suddenly I felt how different I was—how strong my arms and legs were, you know—and how I could dig and stand—and I jumped up and wanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.”

“Th’ Magic listened when tha’ sung th’ Doxology. It would ha’ listened to anything tha’d sung. It was th’ joy that mattered. Eh! lad, lad—what’s names to th’ Joy Maker,” and she gave his shoulders a quick soft pat again.

She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid.

“You see we can’t help laughing nearly all the time when we are together,” explained Colin. “And it doesn’t sound ill at all. We try to choke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.”

“There’s one thing that comes into my mind so often,” said Mary, “and I can scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly. I keep thinking suppose Colin’s face should get to look like a full moon. It isn’t like one yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose some morning it should look like one—what should we do!”

“Bless us all, I can see tha’ has a good bit o’ play actin’ to do,” said Susan Sowerby. “But tha’ won’t have to keep it up much longer. Mester Craven’ll come home.”

“Do you think he will?” asked Colin. “Why?”

Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.

“I suppose it ’ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha’ told him in tha’ own way,” she said. “Tha’s laid awake nights plannin’ it.”

“I couldn’t bear anyone else to tell him,” said Colin. “I think about different ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his room.”

“That’d be a fine start for him,” said Susan Sowerby. “I’d like to see his face, lad. I would that! He mun come back—that he mun.”

One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her cottage. They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and lunch out of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve children and Dickon’s garden and would not come back until they were tired.

Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock. It was time for Colin to be wheeled back also. But before he got into his chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with a kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast.

“You are just what I—what I wanted,” he said. “I wish you were my mother—as well as Dickon’s!”

All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon’s brother. The quick mist swept over her eyes.

“Eh! dear lad!” she said. “Thy own mother’s in this ’ere very garden, I do believe. She couldna’ keep out of it. Thy father mun come back to thee—he mun!”





CHAPTER XXVII
IN THE GARDEN
In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done—then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts—just mere thoughts—are as powerful as electric batteries—as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.

So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push her about for her own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired.

So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place.

“Where you tend a rose, my lad,
A thistle cannot grow.”
While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul. He, was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was, “Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.”

He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she might have her “bit of earth.” He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere more than a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.

But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s soul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his. But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley was very, very still.

As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago. He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind—filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he did not think of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly.

“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over his forehead. “I almost feel as if—I were alive!”

I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does anyone else yet. He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered this strange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he found out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out as he went into the secret garden:

“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”

The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He did not know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But, strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimes half-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one. Slowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew of—he was “coming alive” with the garden.

As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the Lake of Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent his days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep. But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.

“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”

It was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when his thoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. He began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home. Now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes. He shrank from it.

One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. The stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he lived in. He walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water’s edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night. He felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.

He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. He remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was. He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a voice calling. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side.

“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer than before, “Archie! Archie!”

He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a real voice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.

“Lilias! Lilias!” he answered. “Lilias! where are you?”

“In the garden,” it came back like a sound from a golden flute. “In the garden!”

And then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign master might do. No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something more—a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he thought—as if something had changed. He was remembering the dream—the real—real dream.

“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself. “In the garden! But the door is locked and the key is buried deep.”

When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire. It was directed in a plain woman’s hand but it was not a hand he knew. He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his attention at once.

“Dear Sir:

I am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor. It was about Miss Mary I spoke. I will make bold to speak again. Please, sir, I would come home if I was you. I think you would be glad to come and—if you will excuse me, sir—I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here.

    Your obedient servant,
                Susan Sowerby.”
Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope. He kept thinking about the dream.

“I will go back to Misselthwaite,” he said. “Yes, I’ll go at once.”

And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to prepare for his return to England.

In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years past. During those years he had only wished to forget him. Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of him constantly drifted into his mind. He remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead. He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.

He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father at all. He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery. The first time after a year’s absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep, and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.

All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled him through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was “coming alive” began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and deeply.

“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,” he said to himself. “Ten years is a long time. It may be too late to do anything—quite too late. What have I been thinking of!”

Of course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying “too late.” Even Colin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of Magic—either black or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill. If he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things.

“Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good and control him?” he thought. “I will go and see her on my way to Misselthwaite.”

But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby. “Our Dickon,” they volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where he went several days each week.

Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and gave it to “our ’Lizabeth Ellen” who was the oldest.

“If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for each of, you,” he said.

Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away, leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.

The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing. Why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him? How real that dream had been—how wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him, “In the garden—In the garden!”

“I will try to find the key,” he said. “I will try to open the door. I must—though I don’t know why.”

When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the usual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to the remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He went into the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to him somewhat excited and curious and flustered.

“How is Master Colin, Medlock?” he inquired.

“Well, sir,” Mrs. Medlock answered, “he’s—he’s different, in a manner of speaking.”

“Worse?” he suggested.

Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.

“Well, you see, sir,” she tried to explain, “neither Dr. Craven, nor the nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.”

“Why is that?”

“To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be changing for the worse. His appetite, sir, is past understanding—and his ways—”

“Has he become more—more peculiar?” her master, asked, knitting his brows anxiously.

“That’s it, sir. He’s growing very peculiar—when you compare him with what he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began to eat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once and the meals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. The things we’ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf. He’d throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he couldn’t be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir, just without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby’s boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you’ll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until night.”

“How does he look?” was the next question.

“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting on flesh—but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh at all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him. He never was as puzzled in his life.”

“Where is Master Colin now?” Mr. Craven asked.

“In the garden, sir. He’s always in the garden—though not a human creature is allowed to go near for fear they’ll look at him.”

Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.

“In the garden,” he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he stood and repeated it again and again. “In the garden!”

He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was standing in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went out of the room. He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers. He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls. He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken, and he did not know why. As he drew near to it his step became still more slow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried key.

So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment after he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he were walking in a dream.

The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yet inside the garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices—exclamations and smothered joyous cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so—as their excitement mounted—would burst forth. What in heaven’s name was he dreaming of—what in heaven’s name did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had meant?

And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster—they were nearing the garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained—and the door in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.

Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a result of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to look at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.

He was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. It was the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.

“Who—What? Who!” he stammered.

This was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned. He had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashing out—winning a race—perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up to his very tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed through the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look taller than he had ever looked before—inches taller.

“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin. You can’t believe it. I scarcely can myself. I’m Colin.”

Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he said hurriedly:

“In the garden! In the garden!”

“Yes,” hurried on Colin. “It was the garden that did it—and Mary and Dickon and the creatures—and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it to tell you when you came. I’m well, I can beat Mary in a race. I’m going to be an athlete.”

He said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his words tumbling over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven’s soul shook with unbelieving joy.

Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.

“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended. “Aren’t you glad? I’m going to live forever and ever and ever!”

Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders and held him still. He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.

“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last. “And tell me all about it.”

And so they led him in.

The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together—lilies which were white or white and ruby. He remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves. Late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold. The newcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came into its grayness. He looked round and round.

“I thought it would be dead,” he said.

“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin. “But it came alive.”

Then they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to stand while he told the story.

It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought, as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic and wild creatures, the weird midnight meeting—the coming of the spring—the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The odd companionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept. The listener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears came into his eyes when he was not laughing. The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.

“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be a secret any more. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see me—but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk back with you, Father—to the house.”

Ben Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on this occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and being invited into the servants’ hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the most dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present generation actually took place.

One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.

“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked.

Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back of his hand.

“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air.

“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.

“Both of ’em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff. “Thank ye kindly, ma’am, I could sup up another mug of it.”

“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her excitement.

“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.

“Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each other?”

“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only bein’ on th’ stepladder lookin over th’ wall. But I’ll tell thee this. There’s been things goin’ on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An’ what tha’ll find out tha’ll find out soon.”

And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and waved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece of the lawn.

“Look there,” he said, “if tha’s curious. Look what’s comin’ across th’ grass.”

When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants’ hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out of their heads.

Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many of them had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the air and his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in Yorkshire—Master Colin!"
38,The Black Stallion,"Farley, Walter",b045_TheBlackStallion.txt,3,"The tramp steamer Drake plowed away from the coast of India and pushed its blunt prow into the Arabian Sea, homeward bound. Slowly it made its way west toward the Gulf of Aden. Its hold was loaded with coffee, rice, tea, oil seeds and jute. Black smoke poured from its one stack, darkening the hot cloudless sky. 

Alexander Ramsay, Jr., known to his friends back home in New York City as Alec, leaned over the rail and watched the water slide away from the sides of the boat. His red hair blazed redder than ever in the hot sun ; his tanned elbows rested heavily on the rail as he turned his freckled face back toward the fast-disappearing shore. 

It had been fun— those two months in India. He would miss Uncle Ralph, miss the days they had spent together in the jungle, even the screams of the panthers and the many eerie sounds of the jungle night. Never again would he think of a missionary’s work as “sissy” work. No, sir, you had to be big and strong, able to ride horseback for long hours through the tangled jungle paths. Alec glanced down proudly at the hard muscles in his arms. Uncle Ralph had taught him how to ride — the one thing in the world he had always wanted to do. 

But it was all over now. Rides back home would be few. 

His fist opened. Lovingly he surveyed the pearl pocketknife he held there. The inscription on it was in gold: To Alec on his birthday, Bombay, India. He remembered, too, his uncle’s words: “A knife, Alec, comes in handy sometimes.” 

Suddenly a large hand descended on his shoulder. “Well, m’boy, you’re on your way home,” a gruff voice said, with a decidedly English accent. 

Alec looked up into the captain’s wrinkled, windtanned face. “Hello, Captain Watson,” he answered. “It’s rather a long way home, though, sir."""
39,The Little Prince,"Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de",b046_TheLittlePrince.txt,3,"Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.” I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a coloured pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?” My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown- ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: “That is a hat.” Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week. The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: “If you please, draw me a sheep!” “What!” “Draw me a sheep!” I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside. Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: “But, what are you doing here?” And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: “If you please, draw me a sheep...” When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me: “That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep...” But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, “No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep. So then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said: “No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.” So I made another drawing. My friend smiled gently and indulgently. “You see yourself,” he said, “that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns. So then I did my drawing over once more. But it was rejected too, just like the others. “This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time. By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing. And I threw out an explanation with it. “This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.” I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: “That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?” “Why?” “Because where I live everything is very small...” “There will surely be enough grass for him,” I said. “It is a very small sheep that I have given you.” He bent his head over the drawing: “Not so small that, Look! He has gone to sleep...” And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince. It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. The first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: “What is that object?” “That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then: “What! You dropped down from the sky?” “Yes,” I answered, modestly. “Oh! That is funny!” And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you come from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure. You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the “other planets.” I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject. “My little man, where do you come from? What is this ‘where I live,’ of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?” After a reflective silence he answered: “The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.” “That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.” But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: “Tie him! What a queer idea!” “But if you don’t tie him,” I said, “he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.” My friend broke into another peal of laughter: “But where do you think he would go?” “Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.” Then the little prince said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far...” I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house! But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, “Asteroid 325.” I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said. Grown-ups are like that... Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report. If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. If you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,” they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: “I saw a house that cost $ 20,000.” Then they would exclaim: “Oh, what a pretty house that is!” Just so, you might say to them: “The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.” And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: “The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,” then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: “Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep...” To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story. Fori do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures... It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince’s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the colour of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to- middling. In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old. As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince’s planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs. This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly, as if seized by a grave doubt, “It is true, isn’t it, that sheep eat little bushes?” “Yes, that is true.” “Ah! I am glad!” I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added: “Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?” I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh. “We would have to put them one on top of the other,” he said. But he made a wise comment: “Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.” “That is strictly correct,” I said. “But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?” He answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!”, as if he were speaking of something that was self- evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance. Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth’s darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognises it. Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces... “It is a question of discipline,” the little prince said to me later on. “When you’ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes, which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,” the little prince added, “but very easy.” And one day he said to me: “You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,” he added, “there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes... So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. “Children,” I say plainly, “watch out for the baobabs!” My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me. Perhaps you will ask me, “Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?” The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity. Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: “I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.” “But we must wait,” I said. “Wait? For what?” “For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.” At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me: “I am always thinking that I am at home!” Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like... “One day,” you said to me, “I saw the sunset forty-four times!” And a little later you added: “You know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad...” “Were you so sad, then?” I asked, “on the day of the forty-four sunsets?” But the little prince made no reply. On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince’s life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded: “A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?” “A sheep,” I answered, “eats anything it finds in its reach.” “Even flowers that have thorns?” “Yes, even flowers that have thorns.” “Then the thorns, what use are they?” I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst. “The thorns, what use are they?” The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: “The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!” “Oh!” There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: “I don’t believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons...” I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: “If this bolt still won’t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.” Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts. “And you actually believe that the flowers...” “Oh, no!” I cried. “No, no no! I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don’t you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence!” He stared at me, thunderstruck. “Matters of consequence!” He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly... “You talk just like the grown-ups!” That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly: “You mix everything up together... You confuse everything...” He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze. “I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of consequence!’ And that makes him swell up with pride. “But he is not a man, he is a mushroom!” “A what?” “A mushroom!” The little prince was now white with rage. “The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow ' ' I \ thorns, which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I know, I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing, Oh! You think that is not important! His face turned from white to red as he continued: “If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there...’ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!” He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing. The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him: “The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will...” I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more. It is such a secret place, the land of tears. I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince’s planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab. The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself. And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: “Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged...” But the little prince could not restrain his admiration: “Oh! How beautiful you are!” “Am I not?” the flower responded, sweetly. “And I was born at the same moment as the sun...” The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and exciting she was! “I think it is time for breakfast,” she added an instant later. “If you would have the kindness to think of my needs” And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: “Let the tigers come with their claws!” “There are no tigers on my planet,” the little prince objected. “And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.” “I am not a weed,” the flower replied, sweetly. “Please excuse me...” “I am not at all afraid of tigers,” she went on, “but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn’t screen for me?"" “A horror of drafts, that is bad luck, for a plant,” remarked the little prince, and added to himself, “This flower is a very complex creature...” “At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from...” But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong. “The screen?” “I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me...” Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy. “I ought not to have listened to her,” he confided to me one day. “One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.” And he continued his confidences: “The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her...” I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, “One never knows!” So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney. On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us. The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears. “Goodbye,” he said to the flower. But she made no answer. “Goodbye,” he said again. The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. “I have been silly,” she said to him, at last. “I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy...” He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. “Of course I love you,” the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you, you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... let the glass globe be. I don’t want it any more.” “But the wind...” “My cold is not so bad as all that... the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.” “But the animals...” “Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me? You will be far away... as for the large animals, I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws.” And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: “Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!” For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower... He found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge. The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne, which was at the same time both simple and majestic. “Ah! Here is a subject,” exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming. And the little prince asked himself: “How could he recognise me when he had never seen me before?” He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects. “Approach, so that I may see you better,” said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody. The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king’s magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned. “It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,” the monarch said to him. “I forbid you to do so.” “I can’t help it. I can’t stop myself,” replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. “I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep...” “Ah, then,” the king said. “I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.” “That frightens me... I cannot, any more...” murmured the little prince, now completely abashed. “Hum! Hum!” replied the king. “Then I... I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to” He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed. For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable. “If I ordered a general,” he would say, by way of example, “if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.” “May I sit down?” came now a timid inquiry from the little prince. “I order you to do so,” the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle. But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule? “Sire,” he said to him, “I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question” “I order you to ask me a question,” the king hastened to assure him. “Sire, over what do you rule?” “Over everything,” said the king, with magnificent simplicity. “Over everything?” The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars. “Over all that?” asked the little prince. “Over all that,” the king answered. For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal. “And the stars obey you?” “Certainly they do,” the king said. “They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.” Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet, which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour: “I should like to see a sunset... do me that kindness... Order the sun to set...” “If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?” the king demanded. “The general, or myself?” “You,” said the little prince firmly. “Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,” the king went on. “Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable.” “Then my sunset?” the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it. “You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favourable.” “When will that be?” inquired the little prince. “Hum! Hum!” replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. “Hum! Hum! That will be about... about... that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed.” The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored. “I have nothing more to do here,” he said to the king. “So I shall set out on my way again.” “Do not go,” said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. “Do not go. I will make you a Minister!” “Minister of what?” “Minster of...of Justice!” “But there is nobody here to judge!” “We do not know that,” the king said to him. “I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk.” “Oh, but I have looked already!” said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all... “Then you shall judge yourself,” the king answered, “that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to j udge oneself than to j udge others. If you succeed in j udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.” “Yes,” said the little prince, “but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet. “Hum! Hum!” said the king. “I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your j ustice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have.” “I,” replied the little prince, “do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way.” “No,” said the king. But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch. “If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,” he said, “he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favourable...” As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave. “I made you my Ambassador,” the king called out, hastily. He had a magnificent air of authority. “The grown-ups are very strange,” the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey. The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man. “Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!” he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers. “Good morning,” said the little prince. “That is a queer hat you are wearing.” “It is a hat for salutes,” the conceited man replied. “It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.” “Yes?” said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about. “Clap your hands, one against the other,” the conceited man now directed him. The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute. “This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,” the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man against raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game’s monotony. “And what should one do to make the hat come down?” he asked. But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise. “Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince. “What does that mean, ‘admire’?” “To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.” “But you are the only man on your planet!” “Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.” “I admire you,” said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, “but what is there in that to interest you so much?” And the little prince went away. “The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey. The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection. “What are you doing there?” he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles. “I am drinking,” replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air. “Why are you drinking?” demanded the little prince. “So that I may forget,” replied the tippler. “Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him. “Forget that I am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head. “Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. “Ashamed of drinking!” The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence. And the little prince went away, puzzled. “The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey. The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince’s arrival. “Good morning,” the little prince said to him. “Your cigarette has gone out.” “Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven’t time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew ! Then that makes five-hundred- and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.” “Five hundred million what?” asked the little prince. “Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and- one million, I can’t stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don’t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven...” “Five-hundred-and-one million what?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it. The businessman raised his head. “During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don’t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time, well, this is it! I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions” “Millions of what?” The businessman suddenly realised that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question. “Millions of those little objects,” he said, “which one sometimes sees in the sky.” “Flies?” “Oh, no. Little glittering objects.” “Bees?” “Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.” “Ah! You mean the stars?” “Yes, that’s it. The stars.” “And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?” “Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate.” “And what do you do with these stars?” “What do I do with them?” “Yes.” “Nothing. I own them.” “You own the stars?” “Yes.” “But I have already seen a king who...” “Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.” “And what good does it do you to own the stars?” “It does me the good of making me rich.” “And what good does it do you to be rich?” “It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered.” “This man,” the little prince said to himself, “reasons a little like my poor tippler...” Nevertheless, he still had some more questions. “How is it possible for one to own the stars?” “To whom do they belong?” the businessman retorted, peevishly. “I don’t know. To nobody.” “Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.” “Is that all that is necessary?” “Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.” “Yes, that is true,” said the little prince. “And what do you do with them?” “I administer them,” replied the businessman. “I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.” The little prince was still not satisfied. “If I owned a silk scarf,” he said, “I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven...” “No. But I can put them in the bank.” “Whatever does that mean?” “That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.” “And that is all?” “That is enough,” said the businessman. “It is entertaining,” thought the little prince. “It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence.” On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas, which were very different from those of the grown-ups. “I myself own a flower,” he continued his conversation with the businessman, “which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars...” The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away. “The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,” he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey. The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet, which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless: “It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.” When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter. “Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?” “Those are the orders,” replied the lamplighter. “Good morning.” “What are the orders?” “The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.” And he lighted his lamp again. “But why have you just lighted it again?” “Those are the orders,” replied the lamplighter. “I do not understand,” said the little prince. “There is nothing to understand,” said the lamplighter. “Orders are orders. Good morning.” And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares. “I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.” “And the orders have been changed since that time?” “The orders have not been changed,” said the lamplighter. “That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!” “Then what?” asked the little prince. “Then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!” “That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!” “It is not funny at all!” said the lamplighter. “While we have been talking together a month has gone by.” “A month?” “Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.” And he lighted his lamp again. As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets, which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend. “You know,” he said, “I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to...” “I always want to rest,” said the lamplighter. For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time. The little prince went on with his explanation: “Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like.” “That doesn’t do me much good,” said the lamplighter. “The one thing I love in life is to sleep.” “Then you’re unlucky,” said the little prince. “I am unlucky,” said the lamplighter. “Good morning.” And he put out his lamp. “That man,” said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, “that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.” He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: “That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people...” What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books. “Oh, look! Here is an explorer!” he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming. The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already travelled so much and so far! “Where do you come from?” the old gentleman said to him. “What is that big book?” said the little prince. “What are you doing?” “I am a geographer,” the old gentleman said to him. “What is a geographer?” asked the little prince. “A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.” “That is very interesting,” said the little prince. “Here at last is a man who has a real profession!” And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen. “Your planet is very beautiful,” he said. “Has it any oceans?” “I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer. “Ah!” The little prince was disappointed. “Has it any mountains?” “I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer. “And towns, and rivers, and deserts?” “I couldn’t tell you that, either.” “But you are a geographer!” “Exactly,” the geographer said. “But I am not an explorer. I haven’t a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.” “Why is that?” “Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.” “Why is that?” asked the little prince. “Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.” “I know some one,” said the little prince, “who would make a bad explorer.” “That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.” “One goes to see it?” “No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.” The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement. “But you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!” And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink. “Well?” said the geographer expectantly. “Oh, where I live,” said the little prince, “it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.” “One never knows,” said the geographer. “I have also a flower.” “We do not record flowers,” said the geographer. “Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!” “We do not record them,” said the geographer, “because they are ephemeral.” “What does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” “Geographies,” said the geographer, “are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things.” “But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,” the little prince interrupted. “What does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” “Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,” said the geographer. “The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.” “But what does that mean ‘ephemeral’?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it. “It means, ‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.’ “ “Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?” “Certainly it is.” “My flower is ephemeral,” the little prince said to himself, “and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!” That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more. “What place would you advise me to visit now?” he asked. “The planet Earth,” replied the geographer. “It has a good reputation.” And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower. So then the seventh planet was the Earth. The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps. Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent. Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year. When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realise that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet. The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me. When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the colour of the moonlight, flashed across the sand. “Good evening,” said the little prince courteously. “Good evening,” said the snake. “What planet is this on which I have come down?” asked the little prince. “This is the Earth; this is Africa,” the snake answered. “Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?” “This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,” said the snake. The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky. “I wonder,” he said, “whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!” “It is beautiful,” the snake said. “What has brought you here?” “I have been having some trouble with a flower,” said the little prince. “Ah!” said the snake. And they were both silent. “Where are the men?” the little prince at last took up the conversation again. “It is a little lonely in the desert...” “It is also lonely among men,” the snake said. The little prince gazed at him for a long time. “You are a funny animal,” he said at last. “You are no thicker than a finger...” “But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,” said the snake. The little prince smiled. “You are not very powerful. You haven’t even any feet. You cannot even travel...” “I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,” said the snake. He twined himself around the little prince’s ankle, like a golden bracelet. “Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,” the snake spoke again. “But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star...” The little prince made no reply. “You move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of granite,” the snake said. “I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can...” “Oh! I understand you very well,” said the little prince. “But why do you always speak in riddles?” “I solve them all,” said the snake. And they were both silent. The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all. “Good morning,” said the little prince. “Good morning,” said the flower. “Where are the men?” the little prince asked, politely. The flower had once seen a caravan passing. “Men?” she echoed. “I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult.” “Goodbye,” said the little prince. “Goodbye,” said the flower. After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. “From a mountain as high as this one,” he said to himself, “I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people...” But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles. “Good morning,” he said courteously. “Good morning...Good morning...Good morning,” answered the echo. “Who are you?” said the little prince. “Who are you...Who are you...Who are you?” answered the echo. “Be my friends. I am all alone,” he said. “I am all alone...all alone. ..all alone,” answered the echo. “What a queer planet!” he thought. “It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak...” But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men. “Good morning,” he said. He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses. “Good morning,” said the roses. The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower. “Who are you?” he demanded, thunderstruck. “We are roses,” the roses said. And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden! “She would be very much annoyed,” he said to himself, “if she should see that... she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die...” Then he went on with his reflections: “I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees — and one of them perhaps extinct forever... that doesn’t make me a very great prince...” And he lay down in the grass and cried. It was then that the fox appeared. “Good morning,” said the fox. “Good morning,” the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing. “I am right here,” the voice said, “under the apple tree.” “ Who are you?” asked the little prince, and added, “You are very pretty to look at.” “I am a fox,” said the fox. “Come and play with me,” proposed the little prince. “I am so unhappy.” “I cannot play with you,” the fox said. “I am not tamed.” “Ah! Please excuse me,” said the little prince. But, after some thought, he added: “What does that mean, ‘tame’?” “You do not live here,” said the fox. “What is it that you are looking for?” “I am looking for men,” said the little prince. “What does that mean, ‘tame’?” “Men,” said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?” “No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does that mean, ‘tame’?” “It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. It means to establish ties.” “‘To establish ties’?” “Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...” “I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me...” “It is possible,” said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.” “Oh, but this is not on the Earth!” said the little prince. The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious. “On another planet?” “Yes.” “Are there hunters on this planet?” “No.” “Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?” “No.” “Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. “My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. “Please, tame me!” he said. “I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.” “One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready-made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me...” “What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince. “You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me, like that, in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites...” “What is a rite?” asked the little prince. “Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near... “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.” “It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...” “Yes, that is so,” said the fox. “But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince. “Yes, that is so,” said the fox. “Then it has done you no good at all!” “It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. “You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose. And he went back to meet the fox. “Goodbye,” he said. “Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” “It is the time I have wasted for my rose...” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember. “Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...” “I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. “Good morning,” said the little prince. “Good morning,” said the railway switchman. “What do you do here?” the little prince asked. “I sort out travellers, in bundles of a thousand,” said the switchman. “I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left.” And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman’s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder. “They are in a great hurry,” said the little prince. “What are they looking for?” “Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,” said the switchman. And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction. “Are they coming back already?” demanded the little prince. “These are not the same ones,” said the switchman. “It is an exchange.” “Were they not satisfied where they were?” asked the little prince. “No one is ever satisfied where he is,” said the switchman. And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express. “Are they pursuing the first travellers?” demanded the little prince. “They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.” “Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry...” “They are lucky,” the switchman said. “Good morning,” said the little prince. “Good morning,” said the merchant. This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink. “Why are you selling those?” asked the little prince. “Because they save a tremendous amount of time,” said the merchant. “Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.” “And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?” “Anything you like...” “As for me,” said the little prince to himself, “if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.” It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply. “Ah,” I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!” “My friend the fox...” the little prince said to me. “My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!” “Why not?” “Because I am about to die of thirst...” He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: “It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend...” “He has no way of guessing the danger,” I said to myself. “He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs...” But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: “I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well...” I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking. When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory: “Then you are thirsty, too?” I demanded. But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me: “Water may also be good for the heart...” I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again: “The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.” I replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight. “The desert is beautiful,” the little prince added. And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams... “What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well...” I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart... “Yes,” I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the desert — what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!” “I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my fox.” As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...” As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower — the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep...” And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind... And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak. “Men,” said the little prince, “set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round...” And he added: “It is not worth the trouble...” The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming... “It is strange,” I said to the little prince. “Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope...” He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane, which the wind has long since forgotten. “Do you hear?” said the little prince. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing...” I did not want him to tire himself with the rope. “Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.” I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water. “I am thirsty for this water,” said the little prince. “Give me some of it to drink...” And I understood what he had been looking for. I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received. “The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden and they do not find in it what they are looking for.” “They do not find it,” I replied. “And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.” “Yes, that is true,” I said. And the little prince added: “But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart...” I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the colour of honey. And that honey colour was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief? “You must keep your promise,” said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more. “What promise?” “You know, a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower...” I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said: “Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages.” “Oh!” I had been so proud of my baobabs! “Your fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.” And he laughed again. “You are not fair, little prince,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.” “Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.” So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn. “You have plans that I do not know about,” I said. But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead: “You know, my descent to the earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary.” Then, after a silence, he went on: “I came down very near here.” And he flushed. And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me: “Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you — a week ago — you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your way back to the place where you landed?” The little prince flushed again. And I added, with some hesitancy: “Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?” The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions, but when one flushes does that not mean “Yes”? “Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened...” But he interrupted me. “Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening...” But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed... Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say: “Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.” Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: “Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.” I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again: “...Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.” I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing. After a silence the little prince spoke again: “You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?” I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand. “Now go away,” said the little prince. “I want to get down from the wall.” I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall... and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones. I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow. “What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talking with snakes?” I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone’s rifle... “I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go back home” “How do you know about that?” I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope. He made no answer to my question, but he added: “I, too, am going back home today...” Then, sadly, “It is much farther... it is much more difficult...” I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away. “I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle...” And he gave me a sad smile. I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little. “Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid...” He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly. “I shall be much more afraid this evening...” Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert. “Little man,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.” But he said to me: “Tonight, it will be a year... my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago...” “Little man,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting- place, and the star...” But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen...” “Yes, I know...” “It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...” “Yes, I know...” “It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember, how good it was.” “Yes, I know...” “And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present...” He laughed again. “Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!” “That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water...” “What are you trying to say?” “All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travellers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them” “What are you trying to say?” “In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... you, only you, will have stars that can laugh!” And he laughed again. “And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you...” And he laughed again. “It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh...” And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious: “Tonight, you know... do not come,” said the little prince. “I shall not leave you,” I said. “I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble...” “I shall not leave you.” But he was worried. “I tell you, it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes, they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun...” “I shall not leave you.” But a thought came to reassure him: “It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.” That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely: “Ah! You are there...” And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying. “It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true...” I said nothing. “You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.” I said nothing. “But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells...” I said nothing. He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort: “You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink...” I said nothing. “That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water...” And he too said nothing more, because he was crying... “Here it is. Let me go on by myself.” And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again: “You know, my flower... I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world...” I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer. “There now, that is all...” He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move. There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand. And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I am tired.” Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say, not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells... But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower... At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully...” Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars. But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night...” And then the little bells are changed to tears... Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has eaten a rose... Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes... And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance! This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared. Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back."
40,Tuck Everlasting,"Babbitt, Natalie",b047_TuckEverlasting.txt,3,"The sky was a ragged blaze of red and pink and orange, and its double trembled on the surface of the pond like color
spilled from a paintbox. The sun was dropping fast now, a soft red sliding egg yolk, and already to the east there was
a darkening to purple. Winnie, newly brave with her thoughts of being rescued, climbed boldly into the rowboat. The
hard heels of her buttoned boots made a hollow banging sound against its wet boards, loud in the warm and breathless quiet. Across the pond a bullfrog spoke a deep note of warning. Tuck climbed in, too, pushing off, and, settling
the oars into their locks, dipped them into the silty bottom in one strong pull. The rowboat slipped from the bank
then, silently, and glided out, tall water grasses whispering away from its sides, releasing it.
Here and there the still surface of the water dimpled, and bright rings spread noiselessly and vanished. “Feeding
time,” said Tuck softly. And Winnie, looking down, saw hosts of tiny insects skittering and skating on the surface.
“Best time of all for fishing,” he said, “when they come up to feed.”
He dragged on the oars. The rowboat slowed and began to drift gently toward the farthest end of the pond. It was so
quiet that Winnie almost jumped when the bullfrog spoke again. And then, from the tall pines and birches that ringed
the pond, a wood thrush caroled. The silver notes were pure and clear and lovely.
“Know what that is, all around us, Winnie?” said Tuck, his voice low. “Life. Moving, growing, changing, never the same
two minutes together. This water, you look out at it every morning, and it looks the same, but it ain’t. All night long it’s
been moving, coming in through the stream back there to the west, slipping out through the stream down east here,
always quiet, always new, moving on. You can’t hardly see the current, can you? And sometimes the wind makes it
look like it’s going the other way. But it’s always there, the water’s always moving on, and someday, after a long while,
it comes to the ocean.”"
41,“Zlateh the Goat.”,"Singer, Isaac Bashevis",b048_latehtheGoat.txt,3,"The snow fell for three days, though after the first day it was not as thick and the wind quieted down. Sometimes Aaron felt that there could never have been a summer, that the snow had always fallen, ever since he could remember. He, Aaron, never had a father or mother or sisters. He was a snow child, born of the snow, and so was Zlateh. It was so quiet in the hay that his ears rang in the stillness. Aaron and Zlateh slept all night and a good part of the day. As for Aaron’s dreams, they were all about warm weather. He dreamed of green fields, trees covered with blossoms, clear brooks, and singing birds. By the third night the snow had stopped, but Aaron did not dare to find his way home in the darkness. The sky became clear and the moon shone, casting silvery nets on the snow. Aaron dug his way out and looked at the world. It was all white, quiet, dreaming dreams of heavenly splendor. The stars were large and close. The moon swam in the sky as in a sea."
42,"M. C. Higgins, the Great","Hamilton, Virginia",b049_MCHigginstheGreat.txt,3,"Mayo Cornelius Higgins raised his arms high to the sky and spread them wide. He glanced furtively around. It was all right. There was no one to see him greeting the coming sunrise. But the motion of his arms caused a flutter of lettuce leaves he had bound to his wrists with rubber bands. Like bracelets of green feathers, the leaves commenced to wave. M. C., as he was called, felt warm, moist air surround him. Humidity trapped in the hills clung to the mountainside as the night passed on. In seconds, his skin grew clammy. But he paid no attention to the oppressive heat with its odors of summer growth and decay. For he was staring out over a grand sweep of hill, whose rolling outlines grew clearer by the minute. As he stood on the gallery of his home, the outcropping on which he lived on the mountainside seemed to fade out from under him. I’m standing in midair, he thought. He saw dim light touch clouds clustered behind the eastern hills. Bounce the sun beside me if I want. All others of his family were still asleep in the house. To be by himself in the perfect quiet was reason enough for him to wake up way early. Alone for half an hour, he could believe he had been chosen to remain forever suspended, facing the hills. He could pretend there was nothing terrible behind him, above his head. Arms outstretched, picture framed by pine uprights supporting the gallery roof, he was M.C. Higgins, higher than everything."
43,The Birchbark House,"Erdrich, Louise",b050_TheBirchbarkHouse.txt,3,"She was named Omakayas, or Little Frog, because her first step was a hop. She grew into a nimble young girl of seven winters, a thoughtful girl with shining brown eyes and a wide grin, only missing her two top front teeth. She touched her upper lip. She wasn’t used to those teeth gone, and was impatient for new, grown-up teeth to complete her smile. Just like her namesake, Omakayas now stared long at a silky patch of bog before she gathered herself and jumped. One hummock. Safety. Omaykayas sprang wide again. This time she landed on the very tip-top of a pointed old stump. She balanced there, looking all around. The lagoon water moved in sparkling crescents. Thick swales of swamp grass rippled. Mud turtles napped in the sun. The world was so calm that Omakayas could hear herself blink. Only the sweet call of a solitary white-throated sparrow pierced the cool of the woods beyond. All of a sudden Grandma yelled. “I found it!” Startled, Omakayas slipped and spun her arms in wheels. She teetered, but somehow kept her balance. Two big, skipping hops, another leap, and she was on dry land. She stepped over spongy leaves and moss, into the woods where the sparrows sang nesting songs in delicate relays. “Where are you?” Nokomis yelled again. “I found the tree!” “I’m coming,” Omakayas called back to her grandmother. It was spring, time to cut Birchbark."
44,"Bud, Not Buddy","Curtis, Christopher Paul",b051_BudNotBuddy.txt,3," HERE WE GO AGAIN. We were all standing in line waiting for breakfast when one of the caseworkers came in and tap-tap-tapped down the line. Uh-oh, this meant bad news, either they'd found a foster home for somebody or somebody was about to get paddled. All the kids watched the woman as she moved along the line, her high-heeled shoes sounding like little fire- crackers going off on the wooden floor. Shoot! She stopped at me and said, ""Are you Buddy Caldwell?"" I said, ""It's Bud, not Buddy, ma'am.'' She put her hand on my shoulder and took me out of line. Then she pulled Jerry, one of the littler boys, over. ""Aren't you Jerry Clark?"" He nodded. ""Boys, good news! Now that the school year has ended, you both have been accepted in new temporary- care homes starting this afternoon!"" Jerry asked the same thing I was thinking. ""Together?"" She said, ""Why, no. Jerry, you'll be in a family with three little girls ..."" Jerry looked like he'd just found out they were going to dip him in a pot of boiling milk. "". .. and Bud ..."" She looked at some papers she was holding. ""Oh, yes, the Amoses, you'll be with Mr. and Mrs. Amos and their son, who's twelve years old, that makes him just two years older than you, doesn't it, Bud?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" She said, ""I'm sure you'll both be very happy."" Me and Jerry looked at each other. The woman said, ""Now, now, boys, no need to look so glum. I know you don't understand what it means, but there's a depression going on all over this country. People can't find jobs and these are very, very difficult times for everybody. We've been lucky enough to find two wonderful families who've opened their doors for you. I think it's best that we show our new foster families that we're very ..."" She dragged out the word very, waiting for us to finish her sentence for her. Jerry said, ""Cheerful, helpful and grateful."" I moved my lips and mumbled. She smiled and said, ""Unfortunately, you won't have time for breakfast. I’ll have a couple of pieces of fruit put in a bag. In the meantime go to the sleep room and strip your beds and gather all of your things."" Here we go again. I felt like I was walking in my sleep as I followed Jerry back to the room where all the boys' beds were jim-jammed together. This was the third foster home I was going to and I'm used to packing up and leaving, but it still surprises me that there are always a few seconds, right after they tell you you've got to go, when my nose gets all runny and my throat gets all choky and my eyes get all stingy. But the tears coming out doesn't happen to me anymore, I don't know when it first happened, but it seems like my eyes don't cry no more. Jerry sat on his bed and I could tell that he was losing the fight not to cry. Tears were popping out of his eyes and slipping down his cheeks. I sat down next to him and said, ""I know being in a house with three girls sounds terrible, Jerry, but it's a lot better than being with a boy who's a couple of years older than you. I'm the one who's going to have problems. A older boy is going to want to fight, but those little girls are going to treat you real good. They're going to treat you like some kind of special pet or something."" Jerry said, ""You really think so?"" I said, ""I'd trade you in a minute. The worst thing that's going to happen to you is that they're going to make you play house a lot. They'll probably make you be the baby and will hug you and do this kind of junk to you."" I tickled Jerry under his chin and said, ""Ga-ga goo-goo, baby-baby."" Jerry couldn't help but smile. I said, ""You're going to be great."" Jerry looked like he wasn't so scared anymore so I went over to my bed and started getting ready. Even though it was me who was in a lot of trouble I couldn't help but feel sorry for Jerry. Not only because he was going to have to live around three girls, but also because being six is a real rough age to be at. Most folks think you start to be a real adult when you're fifteen or sixteen years old, but that's not true, it really starts when you're around six. It's at six that grown folks don't think you're a cute little kid anymore, they talk to you and expect that you understand everything they mean. And you'd best understand too, if you aren't looking for some real trouble, 'cause it's around six that grown folks stop giving you little swats and taps and jump clean up to giving you slugs that'll knock you right down and have you seeing stars in the middle of the day. The first foster home I was in taught me that real quick. Six is a bad time too 'cause that's when some real scary things start to happen to your body, it's around then that your teeth start coming a-loose in your mouth. You wake up one morning and it seems like your tongue is the first one to notice that something strange is going on, 'cause as soon as you get up there it is pushing and rubbing up against one of your front teeth and I’ll be doggoned if that tooth isn't the littlest bit wiggly. At first you think it's kind of funny, but the tooth keeps getting looser and looser and one day, in the middle of pushing the tooth back and forth and squinching your eyes shut, you pull it clean out. It's the scariest thing you can think of 'cause you lose control of your tongue at the same time and no matter how hard you try to stop it, it won't leave the new hole in your mouth alone, it keeps digging around in the spot where that tooth used to be. You tell some adult about what's happening but all they do is say it's normal. You can't be too sure, though, 'cause it shakes you up a whole lot more than grown folks think it does when perfectly good parts of your body commence to loosening up and falling off of you. Unless you're as stupid as a lamppost you've got to wonder what's coming off next, your arm? Your leg? Your neck? Every morning when you wake up it seems a lot of your parts aren't stuck on as good as they used to be. Six is real tough. That's how old I was when I came to live here in the Home. That's how old I was when Momma died. I folded the blanket and sheet and set them back on the mattress. Then I reached under the bed to get my suitcase. Most of the kids in the Home keep their things in a paper or cloth sack, but not me, I have my own suitcase. I set it on the mattress and untied the twine that held it together. I did what I do every night before I go to sleep, I checked to make sure everything was there. The way there're more and more kids coming into the Home every day, I had to make sure no one had run off with any of my things. First I pulled my blanket out and saw that everything was where it was supposed to be. At the bottom of my suitcase were the flyers. I took the blue flyer out and looked at it again. The paper was starting to wear out from me looking at it so much but I liked checking to see if there was anything I hadn't noticed before. It was like something was telling me there was a message for me on this flyer but I didn't have the decoder ring to read what it was. Across the top of the flyer writ in big black letters were the words LIMITED ENGAGEMENT, then in little letters it said, ""Direct From an S.R.O. engagement in New York City."" Underneath that in big letters again it said, ""HERMAN E. CALLOWAY and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression!!!!!!"" Those six exclamation points made it seem like this was the most important news anyone could think of, seems like you'd have to be really great to deserve all of those exclamation points all stacked up in a row like that. Next the paper said, ""Masters of the New Jazz: "" then in the middle of the flyer was a blurry picture of the man I have a real good suspicion about. I've never met him, but I have a pretty good feeling that this guy must be my father. In the picture he's standing next to a giant fiddle that's taller than him. It looks like it's real heavy 'cause he's leaning up against it trying to hold it up. He looks like he's been doing this for a long time and he must be tired 'cause he has a droopy, dreamy look on his face. There are two men beside him, one playing drums and the other one blowing a horn. It wasn't hard to see what the guy who must be my father was like just by looking at his picture. You could tell he was a real quiet, real friendly and smart man, he had one of those kind of faces. Underneath the picture someone had writ with a black fountain pen, ""One Night Only in Flint, Michigan, at the Luxurious Fifty Grand on Saturday June 16, 1932. 9 Until ?"" I remember Momma bringing this flyer with her when she came from working one day, I remember because she got very upset when she put it on the supper table and kept looking at it and picking it up and putting it back and moving it around. I was only six then and couldn't understand why this one got her so upset, she kept four others that were a lot like it in her dressing table, but this one really got her jumpy. The only difference I could see between the blue one and the others was that the others didn't say anything about Flint on them. I remember this blue one too 'cause it wasn't too long after she brought it home that I knocked on Momma's bedroom door, then found her. I put the blue flyer back in the suitcase with the four older ones and put everything back in its place. I went over to the big chest of drawers and took my other set of clothes out and put them in the suitcase too. I tied the twine back around my bag, then went and sat on Jerry's bed with him. Jerry must've been thinking just as hard as I was 'cause neither one of us said nothing, we just sat close enough so that our shoulders were touching. Here we go again. THERE COMES A TIME when you're losing a fight that it just doesn't make sense to keep on fighting. It's not that you're being a quitter, it's just that you've got the sense to know when enough is enough. I was having this thought because Todd Amos was hitting me so hard and fast that I knew that the blood squirting out of my nose was only the beginning of a whole long list of bad things that were about to happen to me. Todd's next punch crashed into the side of my ear and I fell on the floor and pulled my knees up to my chest and crossed my arms in front of my head like a turtle in a shell. I started scooching toward the bed hoping I could get under it. Todd started kicking me but his slippers couldn't hut me near as much as his fists had. The bedroom door opened and his mother, Mrs. Amos, came in. It seemed like she was having a hard time figuring out what was going on because Todd's right leg got tired from kicking me and he switched over to his left one while she watched. Finally Mrs. Amos said kind of soft, ""Teddy?"" Todd looked up, fell on his knees and put his hands on his throat. He started huffing and puffing with his eyes bucking out of his head and his chest going up and down so hard that it looked like some kind of big animal was inside of him trying to bust out. This was my chance to get under the bed and pull the covers down so they couldn't see me. Mrs. Amos ran over to her son and fell on her knees. She put her arms around his shoulders. ""Teddy? Teddy boy, are you all right?"" She looked over to where I was peeking from under the bed. ""You little cur, what have you done to Teddy?"" Todd coughed out, ""Oh, Mother ..."" He took in two jumbo breaths. ""I was only trying to help ..."" --he was sounding like a horse that had been run too hard in the winter -- ""and ... and look what it's gotten me."" Todd pointed at his jaw and Mrs. Amos and me could both see a perfect print in the shape of my hand welted up on Todd's blubbery cheek. With one quick snatch she had me from under the bed and out on the floor laying down next to Todd. ""How dare you! This is how you choose to repay me? Not only have you struck him, you have provoked his asthma!"" Todd said, ""I just tried to waken him to make sure he'd gone to the lavatory, Mother. I was just trying to help."" He aimed his finger dead at me and said, ""And Look at him, Mother, this one's got 'bed wetter' written all over him."" I'm not bragging when I say that I'm one of the best liars in the world but I got to tell you, Todd was pretty doggone good. It seemed like he knew some of the same things I know, the things I think of all the time and try to remember so I don't make the same mistake more than seven or eight times. Shucks, I've got so many of them rememorized that I had to give them numbers, and it seemed like Todd knew Number 3 of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 3 If You Got to Tell a Lie Make Sure It's Simple and Easy to Remember. Todd had done that. But this wasn't really a good test because Mrs. Amos had her ears set to believe anything Todd said. In her eyes Todd's mouth was a prayer book. But I can't blame Todd for lying like that, having someone who likes you so much that they think everything you say is the truth has got to be a liar's paradise, that might feel so good it could make you want to quit lying. But maybe not, 'cause Todd hadn't quit lying since the second I came to his house. What had really happened was that I woke up from a good sleep because it felt like a steam locomotive had jumped the tracks and chug-chug-chugged its way straight into my nose. When I'd jerked up in bed and opened my eyes Todd was standing next to me with a yellow pencil in his hand. He was looking at it like it was a thermometer and said, ""Wow! You got all the way up to R!"" He turned the pencil toward me, crunched up against the headboard. I saw TICONDEROGA printed on the yellow wood. The whole room smelled like the rubber from the eraser and I was winking and blinking my left eye because it felt like something had poked the back of my eyeball. Todd laughed. ""I've never gotten it in as deep as the N on any of you other little street urchins. I just might enjoy your stay here. Who knows what other things you could be number one in, Buddy?"" I'd already told him twice that my name was Bud, not Buddy. I didn't care that Todd Amos was twelve years old, I didn't care that he was twice as big as me, and I didn't care that his mother was being paid to take care of me. I wasn't about to let anybody call me Buddy and stick a pencil up my nose all the way to the R. I swung as hard as I could at Todd's big balloon head. Somewhere between the time I threw my punch and the time it landed my fist came open and when my hand landed it made a pop like a .22 rifle going off. Todd fell on the floor like he'd been coldcocked. He sputtered and muttered and felt the spot where I'd slapped him. Then a big smile came on his face and he stood up and started walking real slow toward where I was on the bed. He untied his robe and dropped it on the floor like he was getting ready to do some hard work. I jumped to the floor and got my fists up. Todd might've been a lot bigger than me but he'd better be ready, this wasn't going to be a bird's nest sitting on the ground for him. He could kiss my wrist if he thought I was going to let him whip me up without a good fight. Being this brave was kind of stupid. Even though Todd was a puffy, rich old mama's boy who wore a robe and slippers he could hit like a mule and it wasn't too long before I'd decided enough was enough. But the story that Mrs. Amos was hearing from her lying son was only that Todd had tried to wake me up so I could go to the bathroom. Mrs. Amos hated bed wetters more than anything in the world and my bed had a sticky, hot, smelly rubber baby sheet on it. She'd said it wasn't anything personal and after I had proved myself for two or three months I could get a proper cloth sheet but until then she had to protect her mattress. She pulled Todd to his feet and led him to the door. She looked over at me. ""You are a beastly little brute and I will not tolerate even one night with you under my roof. Who knows what you would be capable of while we slept?"" The door shut behind them and I heard a key jiggle in the lock. I plugged the right side of my nose and tried real hard to blow the smell of rubber out of the left side. The key jiggled in the lock again. This time when the door opened Mr. Amos was standing with Mrs. Amos. He was carrying my suitcase. Uh-oh, they'd looked inside. I could tell because the twine that held it together was tied in a kind of knot that I didn't know. This was wrong. They'd promised they'd keep it safe and not look in it. They'd laughed at me when I made them promise: but they did promise. ""Boy,"" Mrs. Amos said, ""I am not the least bit surprised at your show of ingratitude. Lord knows I have been stung by my own people before. But take a good look at me because I am one person who is totally fed up with you and your ilk. I do not have time to put up with the foolishness of those members of our race who do not want to be uplifted. In the morning I’ll be getting in touch with the Home and, much as a bad penny, you shall be returning to them. I am a woman of my word, though, and you shall not spend one night in my house."" She looked at her husband. ""Mr. Amos will show you to the shed tonight and you can come back in tomorrow for breakfast before you go. I do hope your conscience plagues you because you may have ruined things for many others. I do not know if I shall ever be able to help another child in need, I do know I shall not allow vermin to attack my poor baby in his own house."" She talked like this and she wasn't even a preacher or a teacher. Shucks, she talked strange like this and she wasn't even a librarian. I only halfway listened to what Mrs. Amos was saying, I was too busy keeping my eye on my suitcase wondering if they'd stolen anything from it. And thinking about getting even. When I thought she was done talking I reached my hand out for my suitcase but she told Mr. Amos, ""Oh, no. we shall hold on to his beloved valuables."" She laughed. ""This shall be our assurance that nothing comes up missing from the house and that this little animal is still here in the morning. He is far too attached to those treasures to go anywhere without them."" Mrs. Amos was one of those grown-ups who could always think of one more thing to say. ""And that is not all. Before you retire to the shed you shall go to Todd and apologize or I shall be forced to give you the strapping of your life."" I'd been so worried about my suitcase that I didn't even notice the thick black razor strap hanging out of Mrs. Amos's hand. She didn't have to worry, I'd apologize. One beating from these Amoses was enough for me. She grabbed my arm. Mr. Amos walked out of the room with my suitcase, and Mrs. Amos pulled me down the hall to Todd's room. We stood outside the door listening to Todd groan. When Mr. Amos came back, my suitcase was gone. He'd been so quick that I knew my bag couldn't be too far away. She tapped on Todd's door and said, ""Teddy, may we come in?"" Todd's groans got a lot louder. Finally he said, ""Yes, Mother'-choke ... cough- ""come in."" We opened the door and as soon as he saw me Todd got a real terrified look on his face. He scooched up to the headboard and wrapped his arms around his head. Mrs. Amos gave me a shake and said, ""Well?"" I put my head down and started shooting apologies out like John Dillinger shoots out bullets. I aimed at Todd first. ""I know it was wrong of me to hit you. I know you were only trying to help and I'm very sorry for what I did."" I looked at Mr. Amos. ""And sir, I'm sorry that I got you out of your sleep."" He rolled his eyes like that was enough for him. Mrs. Amos was going to be the hardest because just like her ears were set to believe everything that came out of Todd's lips they were set not to believe anything I said. And if I didn't lie good enough she was going to use that strap on me. These Amoses might look like a bunch of cream puffs but if she was anything like Todd I bet she could pack a real wallop. ""And Mrs. Amos, I'm so grateful for all of your help. And I'm really, really sorry"" I looked up and could see she needed more. ""If you give me another chance I promise I’ll do a whole lot better. Please don't call the Home, please don't send me back."" Shucks, going back to the Home was just what I wanted to do, but I was being just like Brer Rabbit in one of the books Momma used to read to me at night when he yelled out, ""Please, Brer Fox, don't throw me into the pricker patch, please, please!"" This was another one of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar of Yourself. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 118 You Have To Give The Adults Something That They Think They Can Use To Hurt You By Taking It Away. That Way They Might Not Take Something Away That You Really Do Want Unless They Are Crazy Or Real Stupid. They Won’t Take Everything Because If They Did They Wouldn’t Have Anything Left To Hold Over Your Head To Hurt You With Later. I stopped talking and gave Mrs. Amos a chance to jump right in. She held her hand up in my face and said, ""Enough. Mr. Amos, give him the blanket and pillow off the bed he was in and put him in the shed."" Todd said, ""Yeah, Buddy, keep a sharp eye out for the vampire bats in the shed."" It was like a miracle, Todd's asthma was gone and he turned into a real chatterbox. ""Oh, and watch out for those spiders and centipedes, Buddy. The last kid who got put in there got stung so bad he was swollen up as big as a whale when we got him out in the morning."" I guess I didn't look scared enough 'cause Todd kept going. ""The kid before that hasn't been found to this day. All that's left is that big puddle of his blood on the floor. Isn't that right, Mother?"" Mrs. Amos said, ""Now, Teddy, hush up, you'll just tire yourself out more."" I noticed that she never denied the things Todd had said about the vampires and centipedes and spiders and puddles of blood. As I followed Mr. Amos I kept a sharp eye out for my suitcase. When we got to the kitchen the first thing I saw was that there was a doublebarreled shotgun leaning against the side of the icebox. I didn't have time to wonder why they'd be so scared they'd keep a big gun like that out in the open because I spotted my suitcase slid way under the kitchen table! I didn't let Mr. Amos know I'd seen it, but it did make me get a lot calmer. We went out of the back kitchen door and down the steps into the dark. We walked around to the back of the shed and he put a key in a padlock. A chain rattled, the lock came off and the door creaked open. Even though it was nighttime there was a whole different, scarier kind of dark in the shed. A colder dark with more grays and more shadows. A old smell leaked out and it seemed like it was the perfect smell that all this gray would have. Mr. Amos nudged me and I took a baby step into the shed. He could kiss my wrist if he thought I was going to beg him and say things like ""I'll do anything you folks ask me if you don't lock me up in here all alone."" I squeezed my tongue between my teeth to hold it still 'cause I know a lot of times your brain might want to be brave but your mouth might let some real chicken-sounding stuff fall out of it. I stood a little bit inside and looked around. Right under the window was a pile of stacked wood. There were a bunch of dusty spiderwebs in front of the little window and someone had pasted old yellow newspapers over the glass so the kids who got locked in here couldn't peek out. Mr. Amos handed me the blanket and pillow and gave me another nudge. I took two more baby steps in. I looked down at the floor. If I was like a normal kid I would've busted out crying, but I just stood there breathing hard. It was a good thing I'd bit my tongue, because I came real close to saying those stupid begging words to Mr. Amos. Right in the middle of the floor there was a big black stain in the dirt! They really were going to make me sleep in a shed with a patch of blood from that kid who had disappeared out of here a couple of weeks ago! The floor went completely black when Mr. Amos pulled the door shut. I couldn't see it now, but I'd re-memorized the exact shape the stain was in. The padlock snapped shut with the loudest click I'd ever heard. THE ONLY THING I could hear was my own breath. It was so loud that it sounded like there were six scared people locked up in the shed. I closed my eyes and thought real hard about making my breathing slow down. Pretty soon it sounded like the five other breathers in the shed had left. I was still scared but now it was that get-real excited-and-want-to-move- around kind of scared. It didn't take too long for my eyes to get used to the dark. There was a gray gas can in one corner next to a bunch of gray rakes and a pile of gray rags, and a gray tire next to some gray fishing poles. Maybe Mr. Amos had only pretended to lock the door. I reached my hand toward the gray doorknob and quick as that I went from kind of calm to being in that stand-in-one-place-with-spit-drooling-down-thefront-of-your-shirt kind of scared. Halfway up the door were three little flat monster heads guarding the doorknob. Each head had two little round eyes staring right at me. The eyes were the only thing in the shed that weren't gray. They were a bright yellow with a big black spot right in the middle. I dropped my blanket and pillow and back-stepped until my legs hit the woodpile behind me. From all the fast breathing going on you'da thought the five other scared people had come back and brought a couple of scared friends with them. Each head had a wide-open mouth with a sharp set of pointy teeth and lips smiling back ready to bite. It felt like the shed was getting smaller and smaller and the little mouths were getting closer and closer. Then I knew what I was looking at. The doorknob guards were three dried-out fish heads that someone had nailed to the door. I ran over to the pile of rags and poked at one of them with my shoe to make sure there weren't any rats or centipedes hiding under it, then I picked it up and hung it over the fish heads so I couldn't see them and they couldn't see me. I picked up my blanket and pillow and had to decide what was the best way to sleep. I knew the door was no good, I'da bet all sorts of bugs and roaches were crawling around. I remember what happened to my best friend, Bugs, when a cockroach crawled in his ear one night at the Home. Four grown folks had held Bugs down whilst they tried to pull it out with a pair of tweezers but the only thing that they did was pull the roach's back legs off. When they were digging around in Bugs's ears with the tweezers you'd've thought they were pulling his legs off, not some cockroach's, I'd never heard a kid scream that loud. After about fifteen minutes of Bugs screaming the joint down they said they were going to have to take him to the emergency room to get the roach out. It was almost morning when Bugs got back. Everyone was asleep except me. I waited until they put him in his bed and turned off the lights. I said, ""Did they get it out?"" He said, ""Oh, hi, Bud. Yeah, they got him."" ""Did it hurt a lot?"" ""Nope."" ""Were you scared?"" ""Nope."" ""Then how come you were screaming so doggone loud?"" He said, ""I didn't know I was, I probably couldn't hear me screaming 'cause that roach was so loud."" I'd seen lots of roaches but I'd never heard one of them make any sound. I said, ""Loud how?"" ""Well, bugs ain't so different from us as you'd think, soon as he saw those tweezers coming at him he was pretty terrified and commenced to screaming, screaming in English too, not some bug language like you'd expect from a roach."" ""Yeah? What'd he say?"" ""All he kept yelling was, 'My legs! My legs! Why have they done this to my legs?' "" That's the true story about how Bugs started getting called Bugs. I'd bet a thousand dollars that there were roaches on the floor of this shed, just waiting to crawl in someone's ear. And I'd bet those Amoses wouldn't've even tried to pull the roach out, and who knows how long I'd've had to listen to some terrified roach screaming his head off right up against my eardrum? I spread the blanket on top of the woodpile and climbed up on it. This put me so I was even with the window. I took a piece of bark and brushed all the spiderwebs from in front of the window, then I put my hand on the glass to see if the newspaper was pasted on from the inside or the outside. I touched paper. I spread my fingers and my hand looked like a yellow-jacket bumblebee, bright yellow with black stripes. This was a great place to have shadow puppets so I made my hand be a wolf and a dog and a duck. After while that got to be pretty boring so I scraped at the paper with my fingernails so I could see outside, but I like to keep my nails bit down real low and the paper didn't budge. I took out my jack knife and tried scraping the newspaper with it. The paper peeled away in little curly yellow strips like that stuff rich people throw on New Year's Eve. I finally got a hole big enough to look out and mashed my eye up against the glass. I could see the back of the Amos house real clean. There was a light on. That had to be Mr. and Mrs. Amos's bedroom. The little bit of light that came through the hole in the paper made me get calm enough that I could lay my head on my pillow and take a nap. WHEN I BLINKED my eyes open, the first thing I noticed was that the light from the Amoses' bedroom was out. The next thing I noticed made me wish I'd stayed asleep. Up at the very top of the shed was the biggest vampire bat you'd ever see! He was hanging upside down asleep, but the smell of me rising up to him would probably wake him up at any minute! I reached over to the window and tried to slide it open. It budged an inch. I rolled off the woodpile and crawled toward the door with the fish head guards. I reached my hand up and the doorknob turned! Mr. Amos was trying to help me! But after the door opened a crack the padlock and chain on the outside held it tight. I looked back up into the rafters to see if the bat had woke up. He was still sound asleep. Just like there's a time that a smart person knows enough is enough, there's a time when you know you've got to fight. I wasn't about to let this vampire suck my blood dry without a war, he could kiss my wrist if he thought that was going to happen. I got up off my knees and picked up the gray rake. I walked over to the woodpile cool as a cucumber. But inside, every part of my guts was shaking. I stood up on the woodpile and held the rake like it was a Louisville Slugger. I eyed where the bat was sleeping and revved the rake like I was going to hit a four-hundred-foot home run. Just before I swung I remembered another one of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 328 When You Make Up Your Mind to Do Something, Hurry Up and Do It, If You Wait You Might Talk Yourself Out or What You Wanted in the First Place. Shucks, I couldn't remember for sure if you killed a vampire by driving a stake in its heart or by shooting it with a silver bullet! If I was wrong and didn't kill the bat right away I was going to be trapped in the shed with a vampire who was probably going to be real upset that someone had woke him up by whacking him with a rake. I took my jackknife out of my pocket and pulled the blade open. That way if I didn't kill him with the rake and it came down to the two of us tussling on the floor maybe a silver blade in his heart would be just as good as a silver bullet. Unless that was what you had to do with werewolves. I raised the rake over my head again, closed my eyes and swung it like I was Paul Bunyan chopping down a tree with one blow. I felt the rake jerk a little when it hit the bat and I opened my eyes just in time to see the vampire get cut right in half. I was kind of surprised it didn't scream or cry or say, ""Curses, you got me!"" Instead the only sound I heard was a kind of rattling like a couple of pieces of paper rubbing together or like dry leaves blowing around in the wind. The next sound I heard was even worse than if the vampire had said, ""Aha, you doggone kid, that hurt, but now I get my revenge!"" It sounded like I'd turned on a buzz saw in the shed. All of a sudden it felt like someone had stuck a red-hot nail right into my left cheek. My hand reached up to grab my cheek and I felt something creepy and prickly there. I brought my hand back down and it was holding the biggest, maddest hornet I'd ever seen. I squeezed my hand shut to crush it but it got in another sting on my palm. What I'd thought was a vampire bat hanging on the ceiling was really a hornets' nest and now there were about six thousand hornets flying around in the tiny shed and each and every one of them was looking for me! Another fire-nail went into my knee and a second one went into my sock. Maybe this was why the other kid that they'd found in here had been as big as a whale, he was swollen up from all the hornet stings! I dropped my shoulder down and charged at the door with all my might. The door banged against the lock but didn't budge a inch. All that happened was the rag I'd covered the fish heads with came off and I got bounced back and landed square on the floor. I jumped up again. This time when I charged at the door I put my hand out like Paul Robeson running down the football field. This wasn't a real good idea, I forgot all about the fish-head door guards. My fingers went right into the mouth of the biggest one and his little needle teeth cut me like a razor. I pulled my hand back and screamed. Another hornet buzzed into my ear and it felt like someone had poured hot wax right down into my brain. The only thing I could think to do was jump on the woodpile and bust the glass out of the window. I grabbed the handles of the window and gave them one more jerk. I guess being scared gives you a lot of strength because this time the window flew open with a loud bang. Three hornets found me at the same time and all four of us fell out of the window. As soon as we hit the ground I rolled as far away from the shed as I could go. I smacked and whacked the hornets that had taken a ride on me and just laid there until I could catch my breath. After while the stings and the fish-guard bite quit hurting so much. I started getting madder and madder. I was mad at the Amoses, but most of all I was mad at me for believing there really was a vampire in the shed and for getting trapped like this where there wasn't anybody who cared what happened to me. I simmered down and started thinking about getting even. I wondered how hard I'd have to pull the trigger (in that double-barrel shotgun for it to go off. I sneaked up the back porch steps to get inside the house. Maybe the vampire bat didn’t say it, but the only thought on my mind was.'' Aha. you doggone Amoses, that hurt, but now I get my revenge!"" THEY HADN'T LOCKED, the kitchen window. It slid open with just a couple of squeaks, then I was inside the Amos house crouched down like a cat burglar, Quick as a rabbit I looked under the table to see if they'd moved my suitcase. It was still there, I got a whole lot calmer when I picked it up and it was the right weight, I didn't think they'd taken anything out of it. I couldn't be sure until I looked inside but I could do that later. I took in a deep breath and looked over at the icebox to see if the shotgun was still there. I let all the air out in a big puff when I saw it. Shucks, you'd think that with the Amoses being so doggone mean they'd worry about leaving a big old gun like that out in the open. What if one of their visitors got real mad at them about something? I unlocked the back door and set my suitcase on the first step of the porch, so I could make a quick getaway after I was through paying these Amoses back. I opened the screen door real quiet and went back into the house. Fair is fair. The Amoses deserved what they were going to get. I can't all the way blame Todd for giving me trouble, though. If I had a regular home with a mother and father I wouldn't be too happy about other kids living in my house either. Being unhappy about it is one thing, but torturing the kids who are there even though they don't want to be is another. It was my job to make sure other kids who didn't know where their mothers and fathers were didn't have to put up with Todd. My heart started jumping around in my stomach as soon as I reached out for the shotgun. It was a lot longer and heavier than I thought it would be. I lifted it and felt how solid the smooth brown wood was against my shoulder. With it up close to my face like this I could smell the gray metal of the barrel and the gun oil Mr. Amos used on it. I aimed the gun at the stove and pretended I was shooting at a elephant or a dragon or a tiger, or best of all, Todd! I imagined how it would feel to creep up to his bed while he was sleeping and put the shotgun barrel right in his nose. After that I'd have to do some quick moving to get the grown-up Amoses. Unless they were real sound sleepers the shotgun going off in Todd's room would give them a clue that something was going on. I lowered the gun. These things were just too dangerous to play with or to take chances with, that's why the first part of my revenge plan was to get this gun out of the way. If something went wrong and the Amoses woke up I didn't want them rushing down to the kitchen to get the gun. I knew they'd shoot me in a flash and tell the Home it was an accident. I took the gun outside and put it on the back porch in a corner where they wouldn't be able to see it until daytime. I felt a lot better when it was out of my hands. When I was back in the kitchen I started opening cupboards looking for the drinking glasses. The first one I opened had the jelly jar they'd given me to drink out of at suppertime. I walked over to the sink and turned on one of the spigots. These Amoses had hot water running right into the house! I let it run for a second to warm up and put a dishrag in the bottom of the sink so the splashing wasn't too loud. When the water was good and hot I stuck the jelly jar underneath until it was filled to the brim. I started down the hall. Todd's door came open easy as anything. I tiptoed over to his bed. He was deep asleep and his hands were crossed on his chest like he was ready for the graveyard. I dipped my middle finger in the water. It felt like the perfect temperature. I held my breath and picked up one of Todd's chubby hands. One of the older boys at the Home told me if you dipped someone's hand in a warm glass of water whilst they're asleep they don't have any choice but to pee the bed. It's something about chemistry and biology making some valve in your guts open up and ... woop, zoop, sloop ... you got a wet bed. I started to dip Todd's fingers in the water. But I couldn't dip more than two fingers at a time. Todd's bed stayed as dry as the desert. I tried holding Todd's hand flat and pouring water over it but he still didn't wet the bed. Finally I decided to just pour the water on his pajama pants. I pulled the blanket and sheet down and emptied the jar. His face twitched a couple of times and for a minute it looked like his eyes were going to come open but they stayed shut. He smiled and the warm water from the jelly jar opened that little valve up and ... woop, zoop, sloop ... he soaked his sheets! I tiptoed out of the room and down the hall and out the door. My favorite saying in the whole world is ""He who laughs last laughs best” so I put my hand over my mouth and whispered, ""Ha-ha-ha."" I picked up my suitcase and walked to the street. Man! I was on the lam, I was just like Public Enemy Number One. If J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI saw me now I'd be in some real serious hot water! BEING ON THE LAM was a whole lot of fun ... for about five minutes. Every time my heart beat I could feel the blood pushing hot and hard on the inside of my sting spots and the bite on my hand. But I couldn't let that slow me down, I had to get out of this neighborhood as quick as I could. I knew a nervous-looking, stung-up kid with blood dripping from a fish-head bite and carrying a old raggedy suitcase didn't look like he belonged around here. The only hope I had was the north side library. If I got there maybe Miss Hill would be able to help me, maybe she'd understand and would be able to tell me what to do. And for now I could sneak into the library's basement to sleep. It was a lot later than I'd ever been up before and I was kind of scared of the cops catching me. I had to be real careful, even if it was the middle of the night, even if I was crouching down, sneaking along the street like Pretty Boy Floyd. At the library I walked past a row of giant Christmas trees that were planted on the side of the building. There was a door on the side with a light burning above it so I kept walking in the shadows made by the big trees. When I got to the back windows, I almost busted out crying. Somebody had gone and put big metal bars on the windows. Even though I knew it was useless I tried tugging at the bars but they were the real McCoy, solid steel. I headed back to the Christmas trees. They were low enough to the ground that no one could see me unless they were really looking, so I started opening my suitcase. Most folks don't have sense enough to carry a blanket around with them, but you never know when you might be sleeping under a Christmas tree at the library so I always keep mine handy. I untied the strange knots that the Amoses had put in my twine and opened the suitcase. I could tell right away that someone had been fumbling through my things. First off, whenever I put the blanket in, I always fold it so that it stops all the other things from banging up against each other, but those doggone Amoses had just stuffed it in without paying no mind to what it was mashing up against. I lifted the blanket out and saw that everything else was still there. You might be able to say that the Amoses were some mean old nosy folks, but you couldn't call them thieves. I picked up the old tobacco bag that I keep my rocks in. I could tell by the way the drawstring was pulled that the Amoses had been poking through this too. I jiggled it up and down in my hand a couple of times and it felt like none of the rocks was missing but I opened it to count them anyway. None of them was gone. Next I pulled Momma's picture out of the envelope I kept it in and held it so the light from the Library's side door would shine down on it. It looked like the Amoses hadn't hurt it. This was the only picture of Momma in the world. Running across the top of it was a sign that was writ on a long skinny flag, it said, BOYS AND GIRLS--FOLLOW THE GENTLE LIGHT TO THE MISS B. GOTTEN MOON PARK. Underneath the sign, between two big wagon wheels, was Momma. She was about as old as I am now and was looking down and frowning. I can't understand why she was so unhappy, this park looked like the kind of place where you could have a lot of fun. In the picture Momma was sitting on a real live little midget horse. It looked tired and dragged out like those big workhorses do, but it had a teeny-tiny body with a big sag where most horses have a straight back. Momma was sitting right in the middle of the horse's back, riding him sidesaddle, except there wasn't any saddle so I guess you have to say she was riding him side-sag. She had two six-shooter pistols in her hands and the way her face looked you could tell she wished she could've emptied them on somebody. And I know who that somebody was. Momma told me it was her father, my granddad. He'd gone and ruined everybody's fun that day by getting in a big fight with my mother about the gigantic white twenty-five-gallon Texas cowboy hat that she was wearing. Momma used to tell me, ""That hardheaded man insisted, insisted mind you, that I wear that horrible hat."" The hat was almost as big as Momma and you could see it was fake because as tall as it was no real cowboy could've wore it without getting it knocked off his head every time he rode under a tree or some telegraph wires. Momma told me that some man used to drag the midget horse all through her neighborhood with a camera and if your momma or daddy signed a piece of paper he'd take some pictures of you, then come back in a couple of weeks so you could buy them. Momma wasn't looking like she had rocks in her jaw because the hat was so fake that a real cowboy would've laughed you out of town for wearing it, she was mad because the hat was so dirty. When she used to tell me about it her eyes would get big and bunny, like the whole thing happened the day before yesterday instead of all those years ago. She'd start moving around our apartment real quick, picking things up and putting them back in the exact same spot. ""Filth!"" she'd say about the hat. ""Absolute filth! Why, the thing was positively alive with germs! Who knows what type of people had worn it?"" I'd say, ""I don't know, Momma?"" She'd say, ""Who knows how many years it had been worn by who knows how many sweaty little heads?"" I'd say, ""I don't know, Momma"" She'd say, ""The entire band on the inside was black and I'm sure it was crawling with ringworm, lice and tetters!"" I'd say, ""Yes, Momma"" She'd say, ""And that horrid little photographer didn't care, do you imagine it ever occurred to him to wash it?"" I'd say, ""No, Momma."" She'd say, ""Of course not, we meant less to him than that horse he mistreated so."" I'd say, ""Yes, Momma."" She'd say, ""But your grandfather insisted. To this day I cannot understand why, but he insisted, insisted ..."" I'd say, ""Yes, Momma."" We had that conversation a lot of times. Me and Momma having the same conversations lots of times is one of the main things I can remember about her now. Maybe that's because when she'd tell me these things she used to squeeze my arms and look right hard in my face to make sure I was listening, but maybe I remember them because those armsqueezing, face-looking times were the only times that things slowed down a little bit when Momma was around. Everything moved very, very fast when Momma was near, she was like a tornado, never resting, always looking around us, never standing still. The only time stuff didn't blow around when she was near was when she'd squeeze my arms and tell me things over and over and over and over. She had four favorite things to tell me, one of them was about the picture and another one was about my name. She'd say, ""Bud is your name and don't you ever let anyone call you anything outside of that either."" She'd tell me, ""Especially don't you ever let anyone call you Buddy, I may have some problems but being stupid isn't one of them, I would've added that dy onto the end of your name if I intended for it to be there. I knew what I was doing, Buddy is a dog's name or a name that someone's going to use on you if they're being false-friendly. Your name is Bud, period."" I'd say, ""OK, Momma."" And she'd say, every single time, ""And do you know what a bud is?"" I always answered, ""Yes, Momma"" but it was like she didn't hear me, she'd tell me anyway. ""A bud is a flower-to-be. A flower-in-waiting. Waiting for just the right warmth and care to open up. It's a little fist of love waiting to unfold and be seen by the world. And that's you."" I'd say, ""Yes, Momma."" I know she didn't mean anything by naming me after a flower, but it's sure not something I tell anybody about. Another thing she'd tell me was, ""Don't you worry, Bud, as soon as you get to be a young man I have a lot of things I’ll explain to you."" That didn't make me calm at all, that was Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself Number 83. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 83 If an Adult Tells You Not to Worry, and You Weren't Worried Before, You Better Hurry Up and Start 'Cause You're Already Running Late. She'd tell me, ""These things I'm going to explain to you later will be a great help for you."" Then Momma'd look hard in my face, grab a hold of my arms real tight and say, ""And Bud, I want you always to remember, no matter how bad things look to you, no matter how dark the night, when one door closes, don't worry, because another door opens."" I'd say, ""What, it opens all by itself?"" She'd say, ""Yes, it seems so."" That was it: ""Another door opens."" That was the thing that was supposed to have helped me. I should've known then that I was in for a lot of trouble. It's funny how now that I'm ten years old and just about a man I can see how Momma was so wrong. She was wrong because she probably should've told me the things she thought I was too young to hear, because now that she's gone I’ll never know what they were. Even if I was too young back then I could've rememorized them and used them when I did need help, like right now. She was also wrong when she thought I'd understand that nonsense about doors closing and opening all by themselves. Back then it really scared me because I couldn't see what one door closing had to do with another one opening unless there was a ghost involved. All her talk made me start jamming a chair up against my closet door at night. But now that I'm almost grown I see Momma wasn't talking about doors opening to let ghosts into your bedroom, she meant doors like the door at the Home closing leading to the door at the Amoses' opening and the door in the shed opening leading to me sleeping under a tree getting ready to open the next door. I checked out the other things in my suitcase and they seemed OK. I felt a lot better. Right now I was too tired to think anymore so I closed my suitcase, put the proper knots back in the twine, crawled under the Christmas tree and wrapped myself in the blanket. I'd have to wake up real early if I wanted to get to the mission in time for breakfast, if you were one minute late they wouldn't let you in for food. UH-OH. My eyes opened and I could see the sun behind the branch of a Christmas tree. I jumped up, folded my blanket inside my suitcase, hid it and started running the six or seven blocks down to the mission. I turned the corner and said, ""Whew!"" There were still people lined up waiting. I started walking along the line. The end was a lot farther away than I thought. The line turned all the way around two corners, then crossed over one street before I saw the last person. Shucks. I walked up to get behind him. He said, ""Line's closed. These here fouls are the last ones."" He pointed at a man standing next to a woman who was carrying a baby. I said, ""But sir ...I' He said, ""But nothing. Line's closed. These here folks are the last ones."" It was time to start lying. If I didn't get any food now I'd have to steal something out of someone's garbage or I wouldn't be able to eat until the mission opened for supper. I said, ""Sir, I--"" The man raised his hand and said, ""Look, kid, everybody's got a story and everybody knows the rules. The line closes at seven o'clock. How's it fair to these people who been here since five o'clock that you can sleep until"" -- he looked at his wristwatch--""until seven-fifteen, then come busting down here expecting to eat? You think you got some kind of special privilege just 'cause you're skinny and raggedy? Look in the line, there's lots of folks look just like you, you ain't the worst. ""Supper starts at six P.M., but you see how thing’s is, if you plan on getting fed you better be in line by four. Now get out of here before 1 get rough with you."" Shucks, being hungry for a whole day is about as bad as it can get. I said. ""But ..."" He reached in his pocket and pulled something out that looked like a heavy black strap and slapped it across his hand. Uh-oh, here we go again. He said. ""That's it, no more talk, you opened your mouth one time too many. You rotten kids today don't listen to no one, but I'm a show you something that'll improve your hearing.'' He slapped the strap on his hand and started walking toward me. I was wrong when I said being hungry for a day is about as bad as it can get, being hungry plus having a big knot on your head from a black leather strap would be even worse. I backed away but only got two steps before I felt a giant warm hand wrap around my neck from behind. I looked up to see whose doggone hand was so doggone big and why they'd put it around my neck. A very tall, square-shaped man in old blue overalls looked down at me and said, ""Clarence, what took you so long?"" I got ready to say, ""My name's not Clarence and please don't choke me, sir, I'll leave” but as soon as I opened my mouth he gave my head a shake and said, ""I told you to hurry back, now where you been?"" He gave me a shove and said, get back in line with your momma."" I looked up and down the line to see who was supposed to be my momma when a woman pointed her finger at her feet and said, ""Clarence, you get over here right now."" There were two little kids hanging on to her skirt. I walked over to where she was and she gave me a good hard smack on the head. Shucks, for someone who was just pretending to be my momma she sure did slap me a good one. I said, ""Ow!"" The big square man who'd grabbed my neck looked at the man with the strap and said, ""Boy had to go use the capper, told him not to waste time, but like you said, these kids today don't listen to nobody."" The strap man looked at the size of the man who called me Clarence and walked back to the end of the line. When the overall man got back in line I said, ""Thank you, sir, I really tried to get…"" But he popped me in the back of the head, hard, and said, ""Next time don't be gone so long."" The two little kids busted out laughing and said, ""Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah, Clarence got a lickin', Clarence got a lickin'."" I told them, ""Shut up, and don't call me…"" Then both my pretend poppa and my pretend momma smacked my head. She looked at the people direct behind us and said, ""Mercy, when they get to be this age ..."" The people weren't too happy about me taking cuts in the line, but when they looked at how big my pretend daddy was and they saw how hard him and my pretend momma were going upside my head they decided they wouldn't say anything. I was grateful to these people, but I wished they'd quit popping me in the head, and it seems like with all the names in the world they could've come up with a better one for me than Clarence. I stood in line with my pretend family for a long, long time. Everybody was very quiet about standing in line, even my pretend brother and sister and all the other kids. When we finally got around the last comer and could see the door and folks going in it seemed like a bubble busted and people started laughing and talking. The main thing people were talking about was the great big sign that was hanging over the building. It showed a gigantic picture of a family of four rich white people sitting in a car driving somewhere. You could tell it was a family 'cause they all looked exactly alike. The only difference amongst them was that the daddy had a big head and a hat and the momma had the same head with a woman's hat and the girl had two big yellow pigtails coming out from above her ears. They all had big shiny teeth and big shiny eyes and big shiny cheeks and big shiny smiles. Shucks, you'd need to squint your eyes if that shiny family drove anywhere near you. You could tell they were rich 'cause the car looked like it had room for eight or nine more people in it and 'cause they had movie star clothes on. The woman was wearing a coat with a hunk of fur around the neck and the man was wearing a suit and a tie and the kids looked like they were wearing ten-dollarapiece jackets. Writ about their car in fancy letters it said, THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE AMERICA TODAY! My pretend daddy read it and said, ""Uh-uh-uh, well, you got to give them credit, you wouldn't expect that they'd have the nerve to come down here and tell the truth."" When we finally got into the building it was worth the wait. The first thing you noticed when you got inside was how big the place was, and how many people were in it and how quiet it was. The only sound you could hear was when someone scraped a spoon across the bottom of their bowl or pulled a chair in or put one back or when the people in front of you dragged their feet on the floor moving up to where they were spooning out the food. After we'd picked up our spoons and bowls a lady dug a big mess of oatmeal out of a giant pot and swopped it down into our bowls. She smiled and said, ""I hope you enjoy?"" Me and my pretend family all said, ""Thank you, ma'am"". Then a man put two pieces of bread and a apple and a big glass of milk on your tray and said, ""Please read the signs to your children. Thank you."" We all said ""Thank you, sir."" Then we walked past some signs someone'd stuck up on the wall. One said, PLEASE DO NOT SMOKE, another said PLEASE EAT AS QUICKLY AND QUIETW AS POSSIBLE, another one said, PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE AND PATIENT--CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF--YOUR NEIGHBORS WILL BE EATING AFTER YOU, and the last one said, we ARE TERRIBLY SORRY BUT WE HAVE NO WORK AVAILABLE. My pretend daddy read the signs to my pretend brother and sister and we all sat at a long table with strangers on both sides of us. The oatmeal was delicious! I poured some of my milk into it so it wouldn't be so lumpy and mixed it all together. My pretend mother opened her pocketbook and took out a little brown envelope. She reached inside of it and sprinkled something on my pretend brother's and sister's oatmeal, then said to them, ""I know that's not as much as you normally get, but I wanted to ask you if you minded sharing some with Clarence."" They pouted and gave me a couple of dirty looks. My pretend mother said, ""Good,"" and emptied the rest of the envelope over my oatmeal. Brown sugar! Shucks, I didn't even mind them calling me Clarence anymore. I said ""Thank you, Momma, ma'am."" She and my pretend daddy laughed and he said, ""It took you long enough to catch on, Clarence."" He acted like he was going to smack me again but he didn't. After we'd finished all our food we put our bowls up and I thanked my pretend family again, I asked them, ""Are you going to be coming back for supper?"" My pretend momma said, ""No, dear, we only come here mornings. But you make sure you get here plenty early, you hear?"" I said, ""Yes, Momma, I mean, ma'am"". I watched them walking away. My pretend brother looked back at me and stuck out his tongue, then reached up and took my pretend mother's hand. I couldn't really blame him, I don't think I'd be real happy about sharing my brown sugar and my folks with any strange kids either. I PUSHED the heavy door open and walked into the library. The air in the library isn't like the air anywhere else, first it's always cooler than the air outside, it feels like you're walking into a cellar on a hot July day, even if you have to walk up a bunch of stairs to get into it. The next thing about the air in the library is that no other place smells anything like it. If you close your eyes and try to pick out what it is that you're sniffing you're only going to get confused, because all the smells have blended together and turned themselves into a different one. As soon as I got into the library I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I got a whiff of the leather on all the old books, a smell that got real strong if you picked one of them up and stuck your nose real close to it when you turned the pages. Then there was the smell of the cloth that covered the brand-new books, the books that made a splitting sound when you opened them. Then I could sniff the paper, that soft, powdery, drowsy smell that comes off the pages in little puffs when you're reading something or looking at some pictures, a kind of hypnotizing smell. I think it's that smell that makes so many folks fall asleep in the library. You'll see someone turn a page and you can imagine a puff of page powder coming up really slow and easy until it starts piling on the person's eye- lashes, weighing their eyes down so much that they stay down a little longer after each blink and finally making them so heavy that they just don't come back up at all. Then their mouths come open and their heads start bouncing up and down like they're bobbing in a big tub of water for apples and before you know it,... woop, zoop, sloop . . they're out cold and their face thunks down smack-dab on the book. That's the part that gets the librarians the maddest, they get real upset if folks start drooling in the books and, page powder or not, they don't want to hear no excuses, you gotta get out. Drooling in the books is even worse than laughing out loud in the library, and even though it might seem kind of mean, you can't really blame the librarians for tossing drooly folks out 'cause there's nothing worse than opening a book and having the pages all stuck together from somebody's dried-up slobber. I opened my eyes to start looking for Miss Hill. She wasn't at the lending desk so I left my suitcase with the white lady there. I knew it would be safe. I walked between the stacks to see if Miss Hill was putting books up. Three doggone times I walked through the library, upstairs and down, and couldn't find her. I went back up to the librarian at the lending desk. I waited until she looked up at me. She smiled and said, ""Yes? Would you like to retrieve your suitcase?"" She reached under the desk. I said, ""Not yet, ma'am, could I ask you a question?"" She said, ""Of course, young man, how may I help you?"" ""I'm looking for Miss Hill."" The librarian looked surprised. ""Miss Hill? My goodness, hadn't you heard?"" Uh-oh ! That's Number 16 of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself, that's one of the worst ones. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 16 If a Grown-up Ever Starts a Sentence by Saying ""Haven't You Heard, ""Get Ready, 'Cause What's About to Come Out of Their Mouth Is Gonna Drop You Head first into a Boiling Tragedy. It seems like the answer to ""Haven't you heard"" always has something to do with someone kicking the bucket. And not kicking the bucket in a calm, peaceful way like a heart attack at home in bed either, it usually is some kind of dying that will make your eyes buck out of your head when you hear about it, it's usually the kind of thing that will run you out of a room with your hands over your ears and your mouth wide open. Something like hearing that your grandmother got her whole body pulled through the wringer on a washing machine, or something like hearing about a horse slipping on the ice and landing on some kid you went to school with. I answered, ""No, ma'am,"" and got my stomach ready to hear about Miss Hill biting the dust in some way that was going to give me nightmares. The librarian said, ""There's no need for you to look so stricken. It's not bad news, young man."" She laughed a quiet, librarian-type laugh and said, ""Really, it's not bad news. Unless you had matrimonial plans concerning Miss Hill."" I pretended I knew what she was talking about, most times if you listen to how grown folks ask a question they let you know what it is they want to hear. I said, ""No, ma'am, I didn't plan that at all."" She laughed again and said, ""Good, because I don't think her new husband would appreciate the competition. Chariemae ………. Miss Hill is currently living in Chicago, Illinois."" I said, ""Husband? You mean she got married, ma'am?"" The librarian said, ""Oh, yes, and I must tell you, she was radiating happiness."" I said, ""And she moved all the way to Chicago?"" ""That's right, but Chicago isn't that far. Here, I’ll show you."" She reached under her desk and pulled out a thick leather book called Atlas of the United States of America. She thumbed through a couple of pages and said, ""Here we are."" She turned the book to me, it was a big map of Michigan and a couple of the states that were next to it. ""We're here."" She pointed to the spot that said Flint. ""And Chicago is here in Illinois."" They looked pretty close, but I know how tricky maps can be, shucks, they can put the whole world on one page on a map, so I said, ""How long would it take someone to walk that far?"" She said, ""Oh, dear, quite a while, I'm afraid. Let's check the distance."" She reached under the desk and pulled out another thick book called Standard Highway Mileage Guide and turned to a page that had a million numbers and city names on it. She showed me how to find Chicago on the line that was running across the page and Flint on the line that was running down the page and then to look at the number that was writ where the two of them joined up. It said 270. She pulled a pencil out and said, ""OK, this is how one figures the amount of time required to walk to Chicago. Now--"" She pulled a third book out. Shucks, this is one of the bad things about talking to librarians, I asked one question and already she had us digging through three different books. She thumbed through the book until she said, ""Aha, it says here that the average male human gait is five miles an hour. OK, assuming that you could cover five miles an hour, all we have to do is divide two hundred seventy by five."" She did it and said, ""Fifty-four hours! Much too long to be practical. No, I'm afraid you'll simply have to wait until Mrs. Rollins comes back to Flint for a visit."" Shucks. Chicago might as well be a million miles away from Flint and Miss Hill might as well be a squashed, crunched-up mess in a washing machine when it came down to helping me now. I thanked the librarian for the bad news and went to sit at one of the big heavy tables so I could think what to do next. Going back to the Home was out, it used to be that we'd get a new kid every once in a while, but lately it seems like there's a couple of new kids every day, mostly babies, and they're most always sick. It's not like it was when I first got there, shucks, half the folks that run it don't even tell you their name and don't remember yours unless you're in trouble all the time or getting ready to move out. After while I got my suitcase and walked into the regular air and stinking smells of Flint. That library door closing after I walked out was the exact kind of door Momma had told me about. I knew that since it had closed the next one was about to open. I went back under my tree and before I knew it I was asleep. SOMETHING STEPPED on a little stick. As soon as the twig cracked my eyes snapped open and I was wide awake. I held my breath and kept as still as I could. Whatever it was that was sneaking up on me knew I'd woked up 'cause it stopped moving and kept as still as it could too. Even though my head was still under my blanket, I could feel two eyes staring at me real hard, and I knew these weren't critter eyes, these eyes made the hair on the back of my neck raise up the way only human beings eyes can do. Without wiggling or jiggling around too much under my blanket I got my fingers wrapped around my jack- knife. Right when I was ready to push the covers off of me and start running or stabbing, whoever it was that had been watching jumped right on top of me. I was as frapped as a roach under a dishrag! I tried to guess the exact spot that the person's heart was at, then pulled my knife back. A voice said, ""If you ain't a kid called Bud from the Home I'm really sorry about jumping on you like this !"" It was Bugs! When I tried to talk it felt like I had to suck all the air out of Flint, I finally got breathing right and said, ""Doggone it, Bugs, it is me! You nearly scared me to death!"" He got off of me and I threw the blanket over to the side. ""You don't know how lucky you are, I was just about fixing to stab you in the heart!"" Bugs looked like he knew he'd just had a real close call. He said, ""I'm sorry, Bud, I didn't mean to scare you, but everybody knows how you like to sleep with that knife open so I figured I'd best grab hold of you so's you wouldn't wake up slicing nobody."" Shucks, even though it was Bugs who'd come real close to getting his heart poked, I was the one who was still having trouble catching my breath. I asked, ""How come you aren't back at the Home?"" But before he had a chance to answer I knew. ""You're on the lam."" Bugs said, ""Yup. I'm going back to riding the rails. When I heard about you beating that kid up so bad that you had to take off I figured it was time for me to get going too. I thought you might be hanging around the library so I come down to see if you wanted to go with me."" ""Where you heading?"" ""There's always fruits to be picked out west, I heard we can make enough money to get by out there. There's supposed to be a train leaving sometime tomorrow. Did you really beat that kid up in the foster home?"" I said, ""Uh-huh, we kind of had a fight. How long's it take to get out west?"" Bugs said, ""Depends on how many trains you got to hop. Was he really two years older than you?"" ""Uh-huh, he was twelve. Is it fun to hop a train?"" ""Some of the time it is, some of the time it's scary. We heard he was kind of big too, was he?"" I said, ""He was pretty big. I can't see how we can hop on a train, they look like they're moving pretty doggone fast."" Bugs said, ""Most times you don't hop them when they're going fast, most times you try to climb on one when it's sitting in the train yard. Did the guy cry after you whupped him?"" ""Well, kind of, he looked real scared, then told his momma to keep me away from him. They even said I was a hoodlum. Will we be sleeping on the train and everything?"" ""Sure we will. Some of the time the train don't stop for two or three days. Man, I always try to tell people that just because someone's skinny it don't mean they can't fight, you're a hero now, Bud!"" ""Naw, I didn't really do nothing much. Well, how 'bout the toilet? How we going to use the toilet if the train doesn't stop?"" Bugs said, ""You just kind of lean out of the door and go."" ""When the train is still moving?"" ""Yeah. You get a real nice breeze."" ""Oh, man! That sounds great! Count me in, I can't wait!"" Bugs spit a big glob of slob in his hand and said, ""I knew I could depend on you, Bud."" I spit a big glob in my hand and said, ""We're brothers forever, Bugs!"" We slapped our hands together as hard as we could and got our slobs mixed up real good, then waved them in the air so they'd dry. Now it was official, I finally had a brother! Bugs said, ""We'll go down to the mission. There's bound to be someone there that knows about where we can hop this train, then we'll be on the lam together!"" WE FOUND OUT that we'd have to go to a city called Hooperville just outside of Flint. The only trouble was nobody knew exactly where Hooperville was. It was dark before we found out the right direction. I'd never heard of a city that was so doggone hard to find. We walked on a trail through some woods that run right up against Thread Crick. We could tell we were getting close to Hooperville 'cause we heard somebody playing a mouth organ and the smell of food cooking was getting stronger. We kept walking in the direction that the sky was glowing with a orangeish light. When we could hear the music real clear, and folks talking to each other and the sound of sticks cracking in a fire, we started cutting through the trees. That way we could peek into Hooperville first. We looked out from behind a big tree and saw that a big wind or even two or three big wolves huffing and puffing real hard could blow Hooperville into the next county. It was a bunch of huts and shacks thrown together out of pieces of boxes and wood and cloth. The Amoses' shed would've looked like a real fancy house here. Right near our tree was the big fire that had been lighting up the sky. It looked like a hundred people were sitting around it, watching things burn or waiting for the food cooking in three big pots set up in the fire. There were two littler fires burning in Hooperville. One had a pot that was big enough to boil a whole person in it. A man was stirring things in the pot with a big stick and when he raised the stick up he'd pull some britches or a shirt out and pass it over to a white man who was hanging the clothes on a line to dry. There was a mountain of clothes on the ground next to him waiting on their turn. The other fire in Hooperville was real small. It was off to the side, by itself. There were five white people sitting at this fire, two kids, a man, and a woman holding a little wrapped-up baby. The baby sounded like all those new sick babies at the Home, it was coughing like it was a half-dead little animal. Bugs whispered, ""Shoot, this ain't no city, this is just another cardboard jungle."" ""A what?"" ""A cardboard jungle, somewhere you can get off the train and clean up and get something to eat without the cops chasing you out of town."" I said, ""Well, what're we going to do? We can't just go busting into this city and expect someone to feed us, can we?"" Bugs said, ""One of us has got to talk to them, let's flip for it."" ""OK."" Bugs rumbled around in his pocket and found a penny. He rubbed it up against his britches and said, ""Heads I win, tails you lose."" ""OK."" He flipped the penny up into the air and caught it, then slapped it down on the back of his left hand. He peeked underneath his right hand to see and a big smile cracked his face. Shucks! Bugs said. ""Tails. You lose."" ""Dang! So what should 1 say?"" ""Ask them if this is Hooperville, see if they got any extra food."" I moved out from behind our tree and walked over toward the biggest fire, I waited until some folks noticed me, then said, ""Excuse me, is this here Hooperville?"" The man who was playing the mouth organ stopped and everyone else around the fire looked up at me. One of the white men said, ""What is it you looking for?"" I said, ""A city called Hooperville, sir."" They all laughed. The mouth organ man said, ""Naw, son, what you're looking for is Hooverville, with a v, like in President Herbert Hoover."" I said, ""Oh, is this it, sir?"" The man said, ""This is one of them."" I said, ""One of them?"" He answered, ""They're all over the country, this here is the Flint version."" ""And all of them are called Hooverville?"" ""That's right, Mr. Hoover worked so hard at making sure every city has got one that it seems like it would be criminal to call them anything else."" Someone said. ""That's the truth!"" I said. ""Well. How’re we going to know if we're in the right one?' The mouth organ man said, ""Are you hungry?"" ""Yes. sir."" ""Are you tired?"" ""Yes, sir. ""Are you scared about what's going to happen tomorrow?"" I didn't want anyone to think I was a baby so I said, ""Not exactly scared, sir, maybe I am a little bit nervous."" The man smiled and said, ""Well, son, anyplace where there're other folks in need of the same things that you are is the right place to be. This is exactly the Hooverville you're looking for."" I knew what the man was trying to say. This was the exact same kind of circletalking and cross-talking that Momma used to do. Bugs hadn't had that kind of practice, he came from behind the tree and said, ""I don't get it, you said there were Hoovervilles all over the place, what if we was looking for the Hooverville in Detroit or Chicago, how could this be the right one to be in?"" The man said, ""You boys from Flint?"" I said, ""Yes, sir."" The man waved his mouth organ like a magic wand and pointed it all over the little cardboard city. ""Boys” he said, ""look around you."" The city was bigger than I thought it was. The raggedy little huts were in every direction you looked. And there were more people sitting around than I first thought too, mostly it was men and big boys, but there were a couple of women every now and then and a kid or two. They were all the colors you could think of, black, white and brown, but the fire made everyone look like they were different shades of orange. There were dark orange folks sitting next to medium orange folks sitting next to light orange folks. ""All these people"" the mouth organ man said, ""are just like you, they're tired, hungry and a little bit nervous about tomorrow. This here is the right place for y'all to be 'cause we're all in the same boat. And you boys are nearer to home than you'll ever get."" Someone said, ""Amen, brother"" The mouth organ man said, ""It don't matter if you're looking for Chicago or Detroit or Ortando or Oklahoma City, I rode the rails to all of them. You might think or you might hear that things are better just down the line, but they're singing the same sad song all over this country. Believe me, son, being on the road is no good. If you two boys are from Flint, this is the right Hooverville for you."" Someone said, ""Brother, why don't we feed these boys? That one looks like he ain't eaten in two or three months."" Shucks, he didn't have to point or nothing, everyone knew who he meant. But I didn't care, the food that was bubbling up in those three big pots even sounded delicious. The mouth organ man said, ""You’re welcome to join us, but we all pitch in here, so's unless either one of you is carrying one of them smoked West Virginny hams in them bags, it looks like you'll be pulling KP tonight."" I said, ""Pulling what, sir?"" He said, ""KP Kitchen Police, you do the cleanup after everyone's had their fill. There're a couple of other young folks who'll show you what you have to do” Me and Bugs both said, ""Yes, sir!"" This seemed like a real good trade. A woman handed me and Bugs each a flat, square, empty tin can. ""That, m'lords, is your china. Please be careful not to chip it."" My china had the words JUMBO A&P SARDINES stamped into the bottom of it. She handed us two beat-up old spoons and said, ""Don't be shy, you two just about missed supper, you'd best hurry up."" She took us over to one of the big pots and filled up our tin plates. ""You're lucky” she said, ""it's muskrat stew and there's plenty left over tonight, eat as much as you can."" The stew was made out of dandelion greens and a couple of potatoes and some small wild carrots and some crawdads and a couple of little chunks of meat. It tasted great! We both even got seconds! When we were done, the woman told us, ""You boys leave your bags here, it's time to do the dishes now."" Uh-oh. ""Ma'am, I like to keep my suitcase with me wherever I go."" ""I promise you your suitcase will be safe here."" I remembered the Amoses had promised the same thing. I said, ""You'll watch it yourself, ma'am? You'll make sure no one looks inside of it?"" She said, ""Son, we don't have no thieving in here, we all look out for each other."" I said, ""Thank you, ma'am"" and put my suitcase down near the woman's feet. Me, Bugs, a little white boy and a little girl loaded a whole mess of dirty tin cans and spoons and a couple of real plates and forks into a big wooden box and lugged them down to Thread Crick. The little girl had been in Hooverville the longest so she got to tell the rest of us what to do. She said, ""I don't suppose neither one of you new boys knows how to do dishes the right way, do you?"" Me and Bugs had done tons of dishes in the Home so I said, ""Sure we do, we used to be real good at cleaning up."" Bugs said, ""Dang, girl, you act like this is the first cardboard jungle I've been in, I know how you do dishes at here."" She said, ""OK then, we'll split them up, you and you""--she pointed at Bugs and the other kid--""can do half, and me and this boy can do the others. What's your name?"" I said, ""Bud, not Buddy."" She said, ""I'm Deza Malone."" Deza handed Bugs and the other little boy some rags and some soap powder and they started splashing the dishes in the water. Me and the girl walked a little farther up the crick and started unloading the rest of the dishes. ""You dry, I’ll wash,"" she said. She handed me a rag and just as soon as she'd splashed one of the tin cans in the water and give it to me I'd dry it and stick it in the wooden box. She said, ""Where you say you was from?"" ""Flint, right here."" ""So, you and your friend come down here to get on that train tomorrow?"" ""Where's it going?"" ""Chicago” she said. ""Is that west from here?"" ""Uh-huh” ""Then yup, that's where we're heading” I said. ""Where you from?"" ""Lancaster, Pennsylvania."" ""You going to take the train too?"" She said, ""Uh-uh. My daddy is. Folks say there's work out west so he's going to try again."" ""So you're going to wait here for him?"" ""Uh-huh."" She was real fast at washing the dishes but I noticed she got kind of slow and was touching my hand a lot when it came to giving them to me. She said, ""Where's your momma and daddy?"" ""My mother died four years ago."" ""Sorry to hear that."" ""It's OK, she didn't suffer or nothing."" ""So where's your daddy?"" ""I think he lives in Grand Rapids, I never met him."" ""Sorry to hear that."" Shucks, she held right on to my hand when she said that. I squirmed my hand a-loose and said, ""That's OK too."" Deza said ""No it's not, and you should quit pretending that it is."" ""Who said I'm pretending anything?"" ""I know you are, my daddy says families are the most important thing there is. That's why me and my momma are going to wait together for him to come back or write for us to come to him."" I said, ""My mother said the same thing, that families should be there for each other all the time. She always used to tell me that no matter where I went or what I did that she'd be there for me, even if she wasn't somewhere that I could see her. She told me .. ."" Shucks, there're some folks who'll have you running your mouth before you know what you're doing. I quit talking and acted like I was having a real hard time drying the tin can she'd just handed me. ""What'd she tell you, Bud?'' I looked at Deza Malone and figured I'd never see her again in my life so I kept shooting off my mouth. ""She would tell me every night before I went to sleep that no matter what happened I could sleep knowing that there had never been a little boy, anywhere, anytime, who was loved more than she loved me. She told me that as long as I remembered that I'd be OK."" ""And you knew it was the truth."" ""Just as much as I know my name's Bud, not Buddy."" She said, ""Don't you have no other kin here in Flint?"" ""No."" ""I guess I can't blame you for wanting to ride the rails. My momma says these poor kids on the road all alone are like dust in the wind. But I guess you're different, aren't you, Bud? I guess you sort of carry your family around inside of you, huh?"" ""I guess I do. Inside my suitcase, too."" She said, ""So you been staying in a orphanage since your momma died?"" ""What makes you say that?"" ""Well, you're kind of skinny, but I can tell by the way you talk and the way you act that you haven't been out on the road for very long. You still look young."" I said, ""Shucks, I'm not all that young, I'm going to be eleven on November fourteenth, and I'm not skinny, I'm wiry. Some folks think I'm a hero."" ""So, Mr. Hero, we're the same age. But you have been staying in a orphanage."" ""I been staying in a home."" ""My daddy says being on the road ain't fit for a dog, much less a kid, how come you don't just go back to your orphanage?"" She started up touching my hand too much again. Deza Malone seemed like she was all right so I came clean with her. ""Don't tell no one, but I lit out from a foster home so I'm on the lam. And I wouldn't go back to the Home even if I could. It's getting so's there's too many kids in there."" ""So? That's better than being cold and hungry all the time and dodging the railroad police."" ""What do you mean?"" ""You don't think they just let people jump on the trains, do you?"" ""Well, I guess I hadn't thought about it."" ""See, I knew you were too nice to have been out on the road, you're going to have a bad surprise tomorrow morning."" ""That won't bother me too much."" She said, ""Oh, yeah, I forgot, you're a hero to some folks."" When Deza smiled a little dimple jumped up in her brown cheek. I didn't answer, I just kept drying tin cans. We got to the last four or five tin can plates and Deza said, ""You ever kiss a girl at the orphanage?"" Uh-oh! ""Are you kidding?"" ""No. Why, you afraid of girls?"" ""You must be kidding."" She said, ""OK” and closed her eyes and mooshed her lips up and leaned close to me. Dangee! If I didn't kiss her she'd think I was scared of girls, if I did kiss her she might blab or Bugs might see me and tell strangers about what happened. I looked down the crick to where Bugs and the other boy were still splashing in the water. It was dark enough that I didn't think they could see us too good. I scooched my lips up and mashed my face on Deza Malone's. We stuck like that for a hot second, but it felt like a long time. When I opened my eyes and pulled back Deza kept hers closed and smiled. She looked down and stuck her hand in mine again and this time I let her keep it there. She looked out at the crick and the woods on the other side and said, ""Isn't this romantic?"" I looked out to see what she was talking about. The only thing I could see was the moon like a big egg yolk way up in the sky. You could hear the water and the sound of the mouth organ man playing a sad song back in Hooverville. I sneaked another peek at Deza's dimple. She said, ""You hear that? That's 'Shenandoah' he's playing. Isn't it pretty?"" ""I guess so."" ""Do you know the words?"" ""Uh-uh."" ""Listen. It's been seven long years Since last I've seen her, Way hey, you rolling river, Been seven long years, Since last I've seen her; Way hey, I'm bound away, ""Cross the wide Miss-oo-ray."" I said, ""Yup, that's a sad song."" I didn't think it was pretty at all. She squeezed my hand and said, ""Isn't it? It's about an Indian man and woman who can't see each other for seven years. But in all that time they still stay in love, no matter what happens. It reminds me of my mother and father."" ""Your dad's been gone for seven years before?"" She looked out over the crick like the big eggy moan had her hypnotized. I pulled my hand from hers and said, ""Well, that's just about it for the dishes."" She smiled again. ""Bud, I’ll never forget this night."" I didn't tell her, but I probably wouldn't forget it either, I'd practiced on the back of my hand before, but this was the first time I'd ever busted slob with a real live girl. We loaded all the dishes in the box and walked down to Bugs and the other kid. We put their dishes on top of ours and headed back. Bugs said, ""How come you're looking so strange, Bud? You look like you been chunked in the head with a rock."" Deza Malone laughed, and for a second I thought she was going to rat me out. I said, ""I don't know, I guess that song is making me kind of sad."" Bugs said, ""Yeah, it is kind of sad."" Right before we got into the cardboard jungle we passed the white people with the coughing baby at their own little fire. I said to Deza, ""How come they're off alone, they aren't allowed to sit around the big fire 'cause that baby's making so much noise?"" Deza said, ""Uh-uh, they been invited, but my daddy said you got to feel sorry for them. All they're eating is dandelion greens soup, they're broke, their clothes are falling off of them, their baby's sick but when someone took them some food and blankets, the man said, 'Thank you very much, but we're white people. We ain't in need of a handout.' "" When we got back to the main fire of Hooverville we put the dishes in another box. Deza made us turn them all upside down so's if the rain got into them they wouldn't rust. I went to the woman with my suitcase. It was in the same spot I'd left it and the knots in the twine were the kind I tie. I said, ""Thank you very much, ma'am."" She said, ""I told you not to worry."" I went back to the big fire to sit with Bugs. The mouth organ man said, ""I suppose you boys are going out on that train tomorrow?"" I said, ""The one for Chicago, sir?"" He said, ""That's the one."" I said, ""Yes, we are, sir."" He said, ""Well, you'd best get as much sleep as you can. It's supposed to be pulling out at five-fifteen, but you never know with these freights."" We got in one of the shacks with some other boys. Bugs was snoring in two seconds, but I couldn't sleep, I opened my jackknife and put it under my blanket. I was thinking. Deza's momma was right, someone who doesn't know who their family is, is like dust blowing around in a storm, they don't really belong any one place. I started wondering if going to California was the right thing to do. I might not know who my family was, but I knew they were out there somewhere, and it seemed to make a whole lot more sense to think that they were somewhere around Flint instead of out west. I opened my suitcase to get my blanket. Even though I trusted the woman who'd guarded it for me I checked to make sure everything was OK. I picked up the tobacco pouch that had my rocks in it and pulled the drawstring open. I shook the five smooth stones out and looked at them. They'd been in the drawer after the ambulance took Momma away and I'd had them ever since. Someone had took a pen or something and had writ on all five of them, but it was writ in a code so I couldn't understand what they meant. One of them said ""kent land in. 5.10.11."" Another said ""loogootee in. 5.16.11” then there was ""sturgis in. 8.30.12"" and ""gary in. 6.13.12"" and the last one said, ""flint in. 8.11.11."" I put them back in their pouch and pulled the string tight. Then I pulled out the envelope that had the picture of the saggy pony at the Miss B. Gotten Moon Park. It was fine. Next I counted the flyers again, all five were there, I slid all of them back, except for the blue one. I held it up so it could catch some of the light from the big fire. I kept looking at the picture and wondering why this one bothered Momma so much. The more I thought about it the more I knew this man just had to be my father. Why else would Momma keep these? I used a little trick to help me fall off to sleep. I pulled my blanket right up over my head and breathed in the smell real deep. After doing this three times the smells of the shack and Hooverville were gone and only the smell of the blanket was in my nose. And that smell always reminded me of Momma and how she used to read me to sleep every night. I took two more breaths and pretended I was hearing Momma reading to me about the Billy Goats Gruff or the Fox and the Grapes or the Dog That Saw His Reflection in the Water or some other story she'd checked out of the library. I could hear Momma's voice getting farther and farther away as I imagined I was in the story until finally her voice and the story all mixed into one. I'd learned that it was best to be asleep before Momma finished the story because if she got done and I was still awake she'd always tell me what the story was about. I never told Momma, but that always mint the fun of the story. Shucks, here I was thinking I was just hearing something funny about a fox or a dog and Momma spoilt it by telling me they were really lessons about not being greedy or not wishing for things you couldn't have. I took two more breaths and started thinking about the little hen that baked the bread. I heard, ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Not I” said the goat. ""Not I” said the big bad wolf” then ... woop, zoop, sloop... I was asleep. I started dreaming about the man with the giant fiddle. He was walking away and I kept calling him but he couldn't look back. Then the dream got a lot better, I turned away from where Herman E. Calloway was and there stood Deza Malone. I told her, ""I really like your dimple."" She laughed and said, ""See you in seven years."" A MAN SCREAMED, ""Get UP, they're trying to sneak it out early!"" I jumped straight up and banged my head on the top of the shack. I ran outside. It was still dark and the fire was just a pile of glowing sticks. The man was screaming at the top of his lungs. ""Get up! They've fired the engine and are fixing to take off!"" Bugs and the other boys came and stood next to me. Bugs said, ""Is it a raid?"" Someone said, ""No, they're trying to sneak out before we get up!"" People started running all over Hooverville. Bugs said ""Come on, Bud, get your stuff, we got to get on that train!"" I folded my blanket up and put it in my suitcase and tied the twine back. I put my jackknife in my pocket and Bugs and I ran outside. I hadn't got six giant steps away when a boy stuck his head out the door and yelled, ""Hey, Slim, is this your paper?"" I looked back. My blue flyer! I forgot to put it back in the suitcase! Bugs said, ""Hurry, I’ll wait."" ""I’ll catch you, go ahead."" I ran back and took my flyer from the boy. ""Thanks a lot!"" I ran back out into the crowd that was tearing through the woods. There were a million men and boys running in the same direction. I didn't want to fold the flyer up so as I was running I slid it between the twine and the suitcase, I'd put it back inside once we got on the train. No one was talking. All you could hear were the sounds of a million feet smacking on the trail and the sound of a million people trying to catch their breath. Finally a hiss sound started getting louder and louder and I knew we weren't too far away. We broke out of the woods and there in the dark sat the train. The locomotive was hissing and spitting coal-black smoke into the sky, every once in a while a big shower of sparks would glow up from inside the dark cloud, making it look like a gigantic black genie was trying to raise up out of the smokestack. The train went as far back as you could see, there must've been a thousand boxcars, but everyone had stopped and was just standing there watching. No one was trying to get on. I pushed my way to the front to see if I could find Bugs and I saw why everyone had stopped. There were four cop cars and eight cops standing between the crowd and the train. The cops all had billy clubs and were spread out to protect the train. The crowd kept getting bigger and bigger. One of the cops yelled, ""You men know you can't get on this train, just go on back to Shantytown and there won't be no trouble."" A white man said, ""This is the only train going west for the next month, you know we got families to feed and have got to be on it. You go get back in your cars and you'll be right, there won't be no trouble."" The cop said, ""I'm warning you, the Flint police are on the way, this here is private property and they have orders to shoot anyone who tries to get on this train."" A man next to me said, ""I'd rather be shot than sit around and watch my kids go hungry."" The cop said, ""This is America, boys, you're sounding like a bunch of Commies, you know I can't let you on this train. I got kids to feed too, and I'd lose my job."" Someone yelled, ""Well, welcome to the club, brother."" It seemed like we stood looking at the cops and them looking at us for a whole hour. Our side was getting bigger and bigger and the other cops started looking nervous. The one who was doing all the talking saw them fidgeting and said, ""Hold steady, men."" One of the cops said, ""Jake, there's four hundred men out there and more coming, I don't like these odds. Mr. Pinkerton ain't paying me enough to do this."" He threw his cop hat and his billy club on the ground. Everybody froze when the train whistle blew one long time and the engine started saying shuh-shuh-shuh. The big steel wheels creaked a couple of times, then started moving. Four of the other cops threw their hats and billy clubs down too. The boss cop said, ""You lily-livered rats,"" and it was like someone said, ""On your mark, get set, go!"" The engine was saying SHUHSHUHSHUHSHUH- SHUH -- and a million boys and men broke for the brain. I got pushed from behind and fell on top of my suitcase. Someone reached down and pulled me up. I squeezed my bag to my stomach and ran. The train was going faster and faster. People were jumping on and reaching back to help others. I finally got to the tracks and was running as hard as I could. I looked up into the boxcar and saw Bugs. He screamed, ""Bud, throw your bag, throw me your bag!"" I used both hands to throw my suitcase at the train. Bugs caught it and when he set it behind him the blue flyer blew out of the twine and fluttered outside the door. But it was like a miracle, the flyer flipped over three times and landed right in my hand. 1 slowed down and put it in my pocket. Bugs reached one arm out and screamed, ""Bud, don't stop! Run!"" I started running again but it felt like my legs were gone. The car with Bugs in it was getting farther and farther away. Finally I stopped. Bugs was leaning out of the door and stopped reaching back for me. He waved and disappeared into the boxcar. A second later my suitcase came flying out of the door. I walked over to where it landed and picked it up. Man, this is one tough suitcase, you couldn't even tell what it had been through, it still looked exactly the same. I sat on the side of the tracks and tried to catch my breath. The train and my new pretend brother got farther and farther away, chugging to Chicago. Man, I'd found some family and he was gone before we could really get to know each other. There were six or seven other people who didn't make the train, so we all walked back toward Hooverville. They must've lit the big fire again, the sky in that direction was glowing orange. The cop that first threw down his billy club walked over to us and said, ""He wasn't lying about the Flint police coming, but they're coming to bust up the shanty-town, you all should get out of here."" When we got close to Hooverville we heard four gun-shots. We all spread into the woods and sneaked up to see what had happened. I peeked from behind a tree and could see a bunch of cops standing around with pistols out. All the men and boys and women that were left in Hooverville were bunched up on one side and the cops were on the other. The fire had been lit and was burning bigger than ever, but now it was burning because the cops were tearing all of the shacks down and were throwing the wood and cardboard and hunks of cloth into the middle of it. One of the cops dragged the big clothes-washing pot over to the side and stuck his pistol down in it and shot four more times. Whew, instead of shooting people they were shooting holes into all of the pots and pans. A man was yelling, ""You yellow-belly lowlifes, you waited till you knew most of the men was gone, you cowards!"" The cops wouldn't talk or nothing, they just kept piling Flint's Hooverville into the fire. I tried to see if I could spot Deza Malone but there were too many people. It seemed like the only good thing that came out of going to Hooverville was that I finally kissed a girl. Maybe someone was trying to tell me Something, what with me missing the train and the blue flyer floating back to me, maybe Deza Malone was right. Maybe I should stay here in Flint. I walked back farther into the woods and sat down. I pulled the blue flyer out of my pocket and opened my suitcase back up. I smoothed the flyer out and took another good look at it. Maybe it came floating right back to me because this Herman E. Calloway really was my father. Wait a minute! I sat up. The names Caldwell and Calloway are a lot alike, both of them have eight letters and there aren't too many names that have a C, a A, a L, and a W all together like that. I remembered what I read in that Little-Big Book, Gangbusters. It said a good criminal chooses a alias that's kind of close to their own name. Except I couldn't figure out who was a criminal here and why anybody needed a alias. I wanted to stay and look for Deza and her mother but it was too hard to hear all the people crying and arguing. Besides. I was still on the lam. I started walking. If I hurried I could get breakfast at the mission. I GOT TO THE FOOD line in plenty of time, but my pretend family wasn't anywhere around. I had to eat by myself, without the brown sugar. After I was through I went back to the library and sat under my tree to wait for it to open. I couldn't stop thinking about Deza Malone and her dimple. How could her father find them now? Finally I saw people going into the library. The same librarian was there again. I said, ""Good morning, ma' am."" ""Good morning, young man. ""Could I please borrow a pencil and a piece of paper and see that book about how far one city is from another again, ma'am?"" She said, ""Of course you may. You know, after I went home last night I finally recognized you. Didn't you and your mother used to come in here a long time ago?"" ""Yes, ma'am"" She said, ""And if I remember correctly you and your mother had quite different tastes in books. I remember your mother used to like mysteries and fairy tales, isn't that so?"" Man, I can't believe she remembered that! ""And you're the little fellow who used to come in all the time and ask Miss Hill for books about the Civil War, aren't you?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" She said, ""I thought so!"" She handed me the pencil and paper and the cities book, then said, ""And when you're done with the book bring it back and I have something special for you!"" She had a huge smile on her face. I said, ""Thank you, ma'am"" but I didn't get too excited 'cause I know the kind of things librarians think are special. I went over to a table and found Flint and Grand Rapids in the lines of the book. I looked where the two lines met and it said 120. Wow! That was going to be a good little walk. Next I wrote down 120. Then divided it by 5, that came up to 24. That meant I’d have to walk for twenty four hours to reach Grand Rapids, one whole day and one whole night. I figured it would be easiest to do the night part first so I decided to stick around the library until it got dark, then head for Grand Rapids. I wrote down all the names of all the cities I'd have to pass through to get there, Owosso, Ovid, St. John's, Ionia and Lowell, and put the paper in my pocket. When I took the cities book back the librarian was still smiling. She said, ""I’ll bet you've been dying to know what your surprise is, haven't you?"" "" I lied. ""Yes, ma'am."" She reached under her desk and pulled out a thick, thick book called The Pictorial History of the War Between the States. Wow! The book was gigantic! ""Thank you very much, ma'am!"" She said, ""Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"" I took the book back to my table. I didn't want to tell her that I wasn't really interested in history, it was just that the best gory pictures in the world came from the Civil War. And this book was full of them. It really was a great book. There's another thing that's strange about the library, it seems like time flies when you're in one. One second I was opening the first page of the book, hearing the cracking sound the pages make. smelling all the page powder, and reading what battle the picture on that page was from, and the next second the librarian was standing over me saying, ""I am very impressed, you really devoured that book, didn't you? But it's time to close now. You may start up again first thing tomorrow!"" I couldn't believe it, it'd happened again! I'd spent the whole day reading. Her words snapped a spell that was on me, and my stomach started growling right away. I was going to be too late for the mission. When she was walking me to the door the librarian stopped at her desk and said, ""Now I know that knowledge is a food, but I couldn't help noticing you never went to eat. You must be very hungry."" She handed me a paper bag and gave me another smile. ""Thank you, ma'am!"" She smiled. ""See you tomorrow."" I said, ""Yes, ma'am. Thank you for everything."" I went back under the Christmas tree and got my suitcase. By this time tomorrow I’d be looking at the face of the man who had to be my father. I started eating the cheese sandwich the librarian gave me. And then I headed out for Grand Rapids. IT'S FUNNY HOW IDEAS ARE, in a lot of ways they're just like seeds. Both of them start real, real small and then ... woop, zoop sloop ... before you can say Jack Robinson they've gone and grown a lot bigger than you ever thought they could. If you look at a great big maple tree it's hard to believe it started out as a little seed. I mean if you pick up one of those maple tree seeds and turn it over a couple of times in your hand there's no way your brain will buy that this little thing can grow up into something so big you have to bend your neck back just to see the top of it. Something so big that you can hang a swing on it, or build a tree house in it, or drive a car into it and kill yourself and any bad-lucked passengers that might be taking a ride with you. Ideas are a lot like that, that's what the idea of Herman E. Calloway being my father started as, something so teeny that if I hadn't paid it no mind it would've blown away with the first good puff of wind. But now here it was so big and important and spread out. The idea first got started when I was looking in my suitcase at one of the flyers showing Herman E. Calloway and his band. That was like the seed falling out of a tree and getting planted. It started busting its head out of the dirt when me and the other boys at the Home were getting our nightly teasing from the biggest bully there, Billy Burns. He'd said, ""I don't even belong in this place. I been put here by mistake and it ain't going to be long before my momma comes and gets me out."" Bugs said, ""Billy. how come it's taking your momma so long to find out where you're at? She must have a real bad memory. Seems like since she was the one what dropped you off here she'd've remembered where she left you by now."" Billy said, ""Well, well, well, will you take a look at who piped up, Mr. Bugs. You know, I've seen lots of people who have roach-infected houses, but you're the first person I've seen who's got a roach-infected head. I wouldn't expect a little ignorant roach-head like you to know nothing about folks coming back here to get you out, you don't even have no idea who your momma and daddy is. Any fool you see walking down the street could be them."" He looked at the rest of us and said, ""Seven little boys in this room and not a one of y'all knows who your folks is. This is a sure-enough sad collection of souls here, I said, ""That's not true, I know who my momma is, I lived with her for six years."" Another boy said, ""Me too, I lived with my momma for a long time."" Billy Burns said to me, ""Is that right? And what about your old man? How many years you live with him? I got a nickel here and you know what it says?"" Billy'd stole a nickel from somewhere and held it up so's the buffalo on it was looking out at us. He pretended the buffalo was talking, it had a deep voice like you'd figure a buffalo would. It said, ""Billy, my man, go ahead and bet this little no-momma fool that he don't know who his daddy is, then I'd have another nickel to bang around in your pocket with” Even before I had a chance to think I said, ""You owe me a nickel, my daddy plays a giant fiddle and his name is Herman E. Calloway."" And with those words that I didn't even mean to say that little seed of a idea started growing. The idea got bigger and stronger when I'd sit up at night and wonder why Momma'd kept those flyers. It dug its roots in deep and started spreading out when I got old enough to understand that Momma must've known she wasn't going to be around too long and was trying to leave me a message about who my daddy was and why she couldn't never talk about him. I knew Momma must be too embarrassed about why he wasn't with us and was trying to break it to me gentle. The only trouble was she waited too long. I mean what other reason could there be for Momma to keep all these things I have in my suitcase and treat them like they were treasures, and why did I know way down in my guts that they were real, real important, so important that I didn't feel comfortable unless I knew where they were all the time? That little idea had gone and sneaked itself into being a mighty maple, tall enough that if I looked up at the top of it I'd get a crick in my neck, big enough for me to hang a climbing rope in, strong enough that I made up my mind to walk clean across the state of Michigan. I opened my suitcase and pulled the flyers out before it got dark. I put the blue one with the writing about Flint on it on the bottom and looked at the others. Two of them had the same picture of Herman E. Calloway and the two guys but the first was called ""Herman E. Calloway and the Terminally Unhappy Blues Band"" they were called ""Masters of the Delta Blues"" and the other one was called ""Herman E. Calloway and the Gifted Gents of Gospel--Featuring Miss Grace ""Blessed' Thomas's Vocals"" they were the ""Servants of the Master's Salvation."" The two other flyers just had little drawings. The first one was a drawing of a accordion and told about a band named ""H. E. Callowski and the Wonderful Warblers of Warsaw"" who were the ""Masters of the Polka."" The second one was of a picture of some mountains and it told about a band named ""H. E. Bonnegut and the Boisterous Big Band of Berlin"" who were the ""Masters of All We Behold."" I put the flyers back in the suitcase and stood up. Just like Bugs, I was going west! FLINT ENDED all of a sudden and I was in the country. It was like one of those days that it's raining on one side of the street and not on the other. Here you have Flint and a sidewalk, you take one baby step, and here you have country and a dirt path. On the sidewalk side a sign said, YOU ARE NOW LEAVING FLINT, HURRY BACK, and on the dirt path side, YOU ARE NOW ENTERING FLINT -- ENJOY YOUR STAY. I jumped in and out of Flint around seven times before that got boring and I decided I'd better head for Grand Rapids. It was already very, very dark and unless things were different in the country it wasn't going to be getting light anytime soon. One hundred and twenty miles. It didn't take too much time before I figured out that twenty-four hours' worth of walking was a lot longer than I thought it would be. I must've only been walking for a couple of minutes when everything changed. First off there were the sounds. Flint could be pretty noisy, what with cars honking horns and trucks with no mufflers on them shifting gears and people yelling out at each other so you couldn't tell if they were happy or about to bust out fighting. Out here in the country the sounds were loud too, but what I was hearing was the sound of bugs and toady-frogs and mice and rats playing a dangerous, scary kind of hide-and-go-seek where they rustle around and try to keep away from each other or try to find each other. Instead of being tagged and called ""it"" like the way human beings play the game, out here the ones that got got, got ate up. Every step I took toward Grand Rapids I could hear the sounds of mouse bones and bug skeletons being busted up by the teeth of bigger things. Every once in a while a couple of cats would give out the kind of howls and yowls that would make the hair on your neck jump up if you were a human being and your heart turn into a little cup of shaky yellow custard if you were a mouse. I walked and walked and walked. Some of the time a car would come by and I'd have to duck into the bushes and wait till it had passed, so I don't think I was doing any five miles a hour. I felt like I'd been walking all night but I'd only gone through three little towns. I was getting so tired that I started to forget to duck in the bushes when a car would roar by. Some of the time they'd see me and step on their brakes for a second, then speed off. Most times they never noticed me. Another car bounced over the top of a hill. The lights blinded me for a second and then I ducked into the bushes again. The guy in the car stepped on the brakes to slow down and I could see him twist his neck around. He stuck the car in reverse and pulled to a stop about thirty giant steps away from where I was hiding. His door opened and he stepped out and started walking slow toward my bushes. He brushed his hand over his head and put on a black hat like the kind the police or some army men wear. But all the cops I'd ever seen were white so I knew this guy must be a soldier. He stopped and put his fingers to his lips and whistled. The whistle was so loud that it made me duck down and put my hands over my ears, it felt like he'd blown it right inside my head. All the bugs and toady- frogs shut right up, they quit chasing and biting each other 'cause this had to be the loudest whistle they'd ever heard too. Rocks were crunching as the man in the black hat walked a couple of steps up the road, then stopped again. For the second time he blasted my ears with that whistle. The noise-making critters in that patch of road got quiet. He said, ""Say hey!"" He waited, then yelled, ""Say hey! I know my eyes aren't what they used to be, but I know they aren't so bad that they'd lie to me about seeing a young brownskinned boy walking along the road just outside of Owosso, Michigan, at twothirty in the morning."" I couldn't tell if he was talking to me or to himself. I peeked up to see if I could get a better look at this man. He came closer to me, then stopped about ten giant steps away. ""And I'll tell you, I've seen some things out of place before and a young brownskinned boy walking along the road just outside of Owosso, Michigan, at twothirty in the morning is definitely not where he ought to be. In fact, what is definite is that neither one of us should be out here this time of night."" He squatted down and said, ""Are you still there?"" I raised my head a little higher to get a better look at him and his big car. He'd left the door open and I could hear the engine of the car grumbling, it was saying, wugga, wugga, wugga, wugga, wugga. ""Son,"" he said, ""this is no time to play. I don't know and I don't care why you're out here, but let me tell you I know you're a long way from home. Are you from Flint?"" How could he tell I was from Flint just by seeing my face for a second in his headlights? I wonder how grown folks know so doggone much just by looking at you. Something was telling me to answer him but I still wanted to get a better look. He stood up. ""You know what? I bet if I can't get you to come out with talk I got something else that might make you show your face. ""From the quick look I got at you, you seemed a little on the puny side. I’ll bet anything you're hungry. Just so happens that I've got a spare baloney and mustard sandwich and an apple in the car. You interested?"" Shucks. How did he know I was so hungry? Then he said, ""Might even have some extra red pop."" Before my brain could stop it my stomach made my mouth yell out, ""But I don't like mustard, sir."" The man could tell which bushes I was hiding in but please open key on me, he didn't bum-rush them or try to get me, he just laughed and said, ""Well, I didn't check, but I don't suppose the mustard's been glued on, I’ll bet you we can scrape it off. What do you say?"" I was carefully talking to him this time so he couldn't track where I was. I turned my head and talked sideways out of my mouth like one of those ventriloquists. ""Just leave them at the side of the road and I’ll get them. And please open the bottle of pop, sir, I don't have a bottle. He squatted back down again and said, ""Oh, no, can't do that. The deal is I feed you, you show me your face."" From the way the man talked he seemed like he was OK and before my brain could stop it my stomach told the rest of me to slide my suitcase deeper into the weeds and walk out. The man stayed squatted down and said, ""I knew I saw something. A deal's a deal so I'll go get your food, all right?"" ""Yes, sir."" He stood up, turned his back to me, then ducked inside the car. A second later he came back with a brown paper bag and a big bottle of red pop. ""Here it is."" He stood there acting like I was going to have to come over to him and get it. ""Could you put them down and I’ll eat them and you can keep driving, sir?"" He laughed again. ""Thanks for your concern, but I've got a little time to spare."" With him standing there in the dark dangling the bottle of red pop out of his right hand and the red taillights of the car behind him shining through the bottle it looked like the reddest red in the world. I walked right up to the man like I was hypnotized. I forgot all my manners and reached right out. He raised the bottle over his head. ""Hold on now."" ""Could I have some of the pop, sir?"" He smiled. ""That's not why I said hold on, I said it because we have some talking to do first.'' My eyes left the bottle and looked at the man. His hat wasn't a cop hat or a soldier hat, it was the kind of cap, men wore who drive fancy cars for rich folks. And it wasn't black, it was red. He said, ""I've got a problem and I need you to help me figure it out."" Uh-oh. What he'd just said is another one of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself. This was Number 87. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 87 When a Adult Tells You They Need Your Help With a Problem Get Ready to Be Tricked— Most Times This Means They Just Want You to Go Fetch Something for Them. The man said, ""My problem is I'm not quite as brave as you are. I'm feeling very, very uncomfortable standing on the side of the road just outside of Owosso, Michigan, at two-thirty in the morning, and the sooner you can put my mind at ease about what you're doing out here the sooner we both can go about our business, OK?"" I nodded. He waited a second, then nodded too. I nodded back. He said, ""Well?"" I was too doggone tired and hungry to think up a good lie. ""Nothing, sir."" He looked disappointed. ""What's your name, son?"" ""Bud, not Buddy, sir."" ""Now there's an unusual name. Did you run away from home, Bud-notBuddy?"" I could tell this guy was poking fun at me but I answered anyway. ""Yes, sir."" ""OK, that's a start."" He handed me the bottle of red pop. He must've had it sitting in ice in the car, it was cold and sweet and delicious. After a couple of seconds he pulled the bottle away from my mouth. ""Hold on, hold on, don't belt it all down on the first pull. There's plenty here."" I slowed way down. ""OK, Bud, you've run away from home, where is that?"" I don't know if it was because of the red pop juicing up my brain or because I'm such a good liar, but one of those things got me thinking again real quick. The first thing I knew was that no matter what I told him this man wasn't going to let me stay out here by myself, but the nervous way he kept looking around was making things seem so scary that not staying out here was OK. The second thing I knew was that I couldn't tell this man about the Home or the Amoses. I wasn't about to let him take me back to either one of them. The man said, ""Where's home, Bud?"" Then another jolt of red pop must've pumped through my heart because my brain came up with a perfect lie. ""I ran away from Grand Rapids, sir."" See how perfect the lie was? Maybe this guy would feel sorry for me and put me on a bus to Grand Rapids and I wouldn't have to do any more doggone walking. He must have some money, anyone driving a car like this would have to be rich or at least know somebody who was rich. The man scratched under the back of his hat and said, ""Grand Rapids!"" He said that like it was the most unbelievable thing in the world, like you'd need to put six exclamation points after it. Something about the way he said it made me nervous but I answered him. ""Yes, sir."" That's the bad thing about lying, once you say one you've usually got to stick with it. ""Well I’ll be ...,"" the man said. ""That's where I'm from, I left there not an hour and a half ago."" He snatched the bottle out of my hand, grabbed my arm, walked me over to the passenger's side of the car and started to open the door. I was glad I was going to be getting a ride but I said, ""Sir, I left my suitcase over in the bushes, can we please get it?"" ""See, my eyes aren't near as bad as I thought they were, I knew you had a box or something. Bud-not- Buddy, you don't know how lucky you are I came through here, some of these Owosso folks used to have a sign hanging along here that said, and I'm going to clean up the language for you, it said, 'To Our Negro Friends Who Are Passing Through, Kindly Don't Let the Sun Set on Your Rear End in Owosso!' "" He must not have trusted me 'cause he kept hold of my arm. We went over to the bushes and I grabbed my suitcase. Then he walked me back to the car. When he opened the passenger's side door I could see that there was a big box sitting on the front seat. The man never let go of my arm and wrestled the box over into the backseat. If he would've let go of my arm for just one second I would've run like the devil was chasing me. On the side of the box some big red letters said as clear as anything, URGENT: CONTAINS HUMAN BLOOD!!! Oh, man, here we go again! My heart started jumping around in my stomach. The only kind of people who would carry human blood around in a car were vampires! They must drink it if they were taking a long trip and couldn't find any people to get blood from. This guy figured he'd rather have my fresh blood than blood out of a bottle! I barely heard him say, ""Get in. I'm going back to Grand Rapids tomorrow, I’ll send a telegram to your folks and then take you back."" Then he made his first mistake, he let go of my arm. I slid into the car and he closed the door behind me. Quick as anything I locked the door and crawled over to the driver's side of the car and pulled that door closed and locked it just as the vampire reached for the handle to get in. I dug around in my pocket and pulled my knife out and put it under my leg. I put my hands on the steering wheel and looked at the gearshift to try to figure which way was ""Go."" I stretched my legs out as far as they'd reach and could just get to the gas pedal. I pulled the gear lever down and the car took off with the vampire running as hard as he could to catch me. Wow! If I kept things like this up I would knock Baby Face Nelson off the FBI's ten most wanted list! THE CAR ONLY WENT thirty giant steps before it commenced to bucking and finally cut right off. The vampire guy finally caught up with me. He was looking very surprised, he just tapped on the window with his knuckle. He said, ""Roll the window down for a minute, Bud."" Sometimes it's terrible to have been brought up proper. I couldn't help myself, I rolled the window down just enough so that our words could get in and out but his hand or claws couldn't. He said, ""OK, what's this'!"" I said, ""Don't you think I can read? How come you're carrying real human blood around in your car?"" I showed him my jackknife. ""I'll warn you, I know how to kill vampires. This knife is genuine solid twenty-four- karat silver."" He put both of his hands over his face and shook his head back and forth a couple of times. He said, ""Sweet baby Jesus, why me?"" Then he said, ""Bud, if you were from Flint I might think you believe that, but you're a Grand Rapids boy, you've got to be smarter than that. If I was a vampire why have I got that sandwich and bottle of red pop?"" I thought for a second, then the answer jumped out. ""Bait!"" He put his hands back over his face. This time when he pulled them away he was laughing. He said, ""Bud, if I was a vampire I wouldn't have to catch little boys, I'd just stick my fangs into one of those bottles and have my supper. Besides, where've you ever heard of a vampire that knew how to drive a car?"" That made sense, in all the moving picture shows I'd seen and all the books I'd read about vampires I never could think of seeing one that could drive a car. But I wasn't going to take any chances. ""Could I please see your teeth, sir?"" ""What?"" ""Your teeth, sir."" The man mumbled something, shook his head again, then leaned close to the window glass and opened his mouth. Even though he didn't have fangs his teeth still looked kinda scary. They looked like they could bite a pretty good grapefruit-sized chunk out of you. Then he said, ""Bud, I've got to get this blood to Hurley Hospital in Flint, they need it right away for someone's operation. I can look at you and tell you're far too smart to believe in any nonsense like vampires, son. Be a good boy and open the door."" I pulled the lock up for him and scooted over to the passenger's side of the car. I unlocked my door just in case he had any tricks up his sleeve. He got in the car and said, ""You'll never know how grateful I am to you, Bud. I’ll take that horrible image of you putting the car in gear to drive away while I stood by the side of the road in Owosso, Michigan, at two- thirty in the morning to my grave with me. Thank God you don't know how to drive."" ""No, sir, but if you'da showed me some fangs I'da learned real quick."" Just in case, I watched the way he put the car in gear so's the next time something like this happened I'd know how to make a clean getaway. Me and the man headed back toward Flint, driving over the same road it took me so long to walk. Going like this I wasn't never going to get away from this doggone city. We hadn't been driving for a minute before he started asking a whole slew of questions. Questions that I had to be very careful about giving the right answers to. He said, ""Don't you feel bad about worrying your mother like this, Bud-notBuddy?"" ""My mother is dead, sir."" Most times if you tell a adult that they'll leave you alone, but not this man. ""What? I'm sorry to hear that, Bud. So you stay with your daddy?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Right in Grand Rapids?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""What's his name, does he work for the railroad?"" ""No, sir."" The seed started sticking its head out further and further. ""His name is Herman E. Calloway and he plays the biggest doggone fiddle you'll ever see."" The man shouted, ""What?"" I said, ""Really, sir, I swear 'fore God it's the biggest fiddle in the world"" He said, ""I know your father, everybody in Grand Rapids does."" I didn't say anything. He said, ""Well, I’ll be. You know, at first glimpse I wouldn't say you look that much like Herman, but now that I look at you I suppose you do. Of course he's quite a bit bigger, if you know what I mean."" This was the best news I'd had all day, my face nearly split in half from my giant smile. ""Yes, sir, folks say I'm the spitting image of my old man."" He really started shooting the questions at me so to stop him I said, ""Sir, could I please have the sandwich and the rest of the red pop before I answer any more questions?"" He slapped his forehead and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, Bud, I was so surprised about who you are and so happy that you didn't drive off that I forgot all about our deal."" He handed me the sandwich and the pop and the apple. I was so hungry that I forgot all about scraping the mustard off the baloney sandwich and even like that it was the best sandwich I'd ever had in my life. ""Bud"" he said, ""my name's Mr. Lewis. Now if you were about fifteen, twenty years older you could call me Lefty. But you're not, so you can't. Mr. Lewis will do just fine."" I shoved the part of the sandwich that I was chewing into the side of my mouth so I could say, ""Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis, sir."" He said, ""I'm not ashamed to admit it, you gave me a scare here tonight that I’ll never forget. I just know I’ll be having nightmares about meeting you for the rest of my life. I’ll wake up in a cold sweat many a night with the picture of you and my car pulling away with that blood on the seat. ""I can see it all now, I’ll be sound asleep, deep in the middle of a Ruth Dandridge dream, when all of a sudden I’ll be standing on the side of the road in Owosso, Michigan, at two-thirty in the morning and I’ll be seeing my car and that blood pulling away with nothing of you showing but that little peanuthead of yours peeking up over the dash."" He looked at me out of the side of his eye. ""Anyone ever tell you you've got a little peanut-head?"" I gulped down the pop I'd been swishing around in my mouth and said, ""No, sir."" ""Well,"" he said, ""this may be the first time but unless you undergo some major surgery I’ll bet it won't be the last."" ""Yes, sir."" He waited a second, then sounded kind of disappointed when he said, ""Don't take it so seriously, Bud, I am teasing, you know."" I started in on the apple. ""Yes, sir."" ""Ever been in the army, Bud?"" ""No, sir."" ""Well, I've got to tell you, I haven't heard so many 'sirs' since I was back at Fort Gordon in Georgia training for the Big War."" I almost said, ""Yes, sir,"" but I looked at him and guessed he was still teasing. I took another drink of the red pop and saw that when I was raising the bottle I'd accidentally let some of the sandwich slip out of my mouth down into the pop. There were a couple of chunks of chewed-up bread, a blob of baloney and some of the mustard swimming around in the bottle. The mustard was real pretty, it looked like some kind of magical fog, every time I moved the bottle the mustardy smoke went into a different kind of shape. Lefty Lewis said, ""How about sharing that pop, Bud?"" Uh-oh. He took one look and handed it back. He said, ""Nothing personal, Bud, I've raised three kids and have two grandkids, I've learned the hard way about drinking after young folks. But I do believe you need to get in and see a doctor soon, son, it looks to me like you've got a serious backwash problem, that's the most food I've ever seen floating around in a bottle of pop. In fact, that doesn't look like red pop anymore, it looks more like red stew."" I real quick chugged the rest of the pop down and ate the apple real slow because I figured as soon as I was done with it the questions would start up again. Lefty Lewis said, ""Aren't you sleepy?"" This was perfect! I could pretend I was falling asleep and then come up with some answers that would get me to Grand Rapids for sure. I yawned real big. ""A little bit, sir."" ""All right, here, give me that core, I think the only thing that's left is a seed or two anyway."" I handed him the apple core and he put it and the wax paper from the sandwich in the paper bag. ""You just stretch out there and have some sleep. In about an hour you'll be in a nice comfortable bed. We can have our talk in the morning."" He reached in the backseat and said, ""Here"" and handed me a jacket. ""You can use this for a blanket."" The jacket smelled real good, like spice and soap. Lefty Lewis said, ""Oh, Bud-not-Buddy, one more thing before you doze off. Could you reach over into that box and hand me one of those bottles of blood? I haven't had a bite to eat all day."" I kept my eyes closed and smiled. I knew I was going to be safe, because I'd never heard of a vampire that could drive a car and I'd never seen one that had such a good sense of humor. Besides, I kept my jackknife open under my leg and he looked like he'd believed me when I told him it was made out of real silver, even though it probably wasn't. As soon as I had the jacket over me the smell of the spice and soap and the sound of the crickets and toady- frogs outside made my eyes get real heavy. Wow! I must have been real, real tired. Walking and ducking in and out of the bushes between Flint and Owosso was a lot more work than I thought it was. Most of the time since Momma died, if someone even walks close to where I'm sleeping I'm up in a flash, my eyes fly open and I'm looking right at them. At one of the foster houses where I'd stayed a woman told me she knew I was going to be a criminal because ""anyone who sleeps that light has got to have a guilty conscience."" Most of the time the sound of someone else going from sleep breathing to awake breathing in the same room as me is enough to get me up. But this morning I felt like I was at the bottom of a well that someone had filled with tons of thick chocolate pudding. Someone was calling my name from way up at the top of the well. She was saying, ""Bud. Bud. Bud."" Waves from the pudding were slogging me back and forth, back and forth. ""Bud. Wake up, Bud."" It was a woman's voice and her hands were trying to shake me awake. Uh-oh. This is Number 29 of my rules: RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 29 When You Wake Up and Don't Know for Sure Where You're. At end There's a Bunch of people Standing Around You. It's Best to pretend You're Still Asleep, Until You Can Figure Out What's Going On and What You Should Do. I kept my eyes closed, acting like I was out cold. The woman said, ""Poppa, what on earth are all these lumps and bites on this baby's face?"" A man answered, ""Well, he was walking all the way From Grand Rapids to Flint, it looks like he provided a pretty paltry meal for every mosquito on the way."" The woman said, ""This poor child must be dead. I hate getting him up. I wish he could stay with us for a while, at least until he's had his sleep."" Then I remembered who I was with because Lefty Lewis said, ""I know, but I've got to get back. He can sleep in the car on the way back to Grand Rapids."" The woman rolled back the blanket they'd put over me and said, ""Poppa, look at his legs, this boy's as skinny as a rail."" Shucks, they'd taken off my knickers when they put me in this bed. Now I was going to have to pretend I was asleep even longer, at least until I could figure a way out of being so embarrassed. Lefty Lewis said, ""Yeah, he's puny. Good thing his legs don't touch when he walks 'cause if those two twigs got to rubbing against one another he'd have a fire going in no time."" The woman said, ""That's not funny. He doesn't look like he's been fed right. Now who's his father again, you said you know him?"" ""Everyone in Grand Rapids does, I'm surprised you can't remember him. He's quite a big fish there."" See! I told you it was smart to pretend you were asleep some of the time. Now I was going to learn some things about my father. The woman said, ""What kind of man is he that he let this child be so thin? And look at the condition of the boy's clothes. Everything is either too small for him or almost in tatters. Where is this child's mother? There's not much of a woman's touch about him."" Lefty Lewis said, ""It seems to me that the Mrs. Calloway I knew passed a long time ago. The boy says he's ten and I'm sure she died quite a while before that. But you know how musicians are, there must be at least a few Mrs. Calloways I don't know anything about."" That meant that my dad was married to someone before he married my mom. Lefty Lewis's daughter said, ""Well, I think it's a sin. I'm of half a mind to keep this boy for a while to put some fear in his daddy's heart. But he probably wouldn't even miss him."" Lefty Lewis said, ""Now you stop being so judgmental, Herman's got a reputation for being no-nonsense, not mean."" ""Does this child have any brothers or sisters?"" ""I believe he's got a sister, but she'd have to be his half-sister, she must be fullgrown by now."" The woman pulled the blanket back over my legs and shook me again. I was glad I could stop pretending I was asleep, I was sick and tired of hearing about how skinny I am and what a mixed-up family I come from. She said real soft, ""Bud, wake up. Come on, sweetie, I've got a nice breakfast waiting for you."" Food! I started blinking and acting like those were the first words I'd heard that morning. I said, ""Huh?"" like I was kind of confused. The woman smiled real big and said, ""Oh-he, I see that got your attention, didn't it? Good morning, young man."" ""Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, Mr. Lewis."" He said, ""Hey, you remembered my name, I'm impressed. Good morning, Walking Willie. We've got to hit the road in a bit, better hurry up and get some food in your belly."" He acted like he was whispering just to me when he said, ""The food in this joint ain't the best, but I guarantee after you eat here you won't be hungry for days, this meal's going to be sitting on your stomach like a rock for a good long time."" The woman said, ""Ignore him, Bud. My father doesn't mean anything, he just can't stop teasing."" I said, ""I know, ma'am, he told me I've got a head shaped like a peanut."" The woman slapped her father on the arm. ""Poppa! I can't believe you've teased this child already. What is on your mind?"" Lefty Lewis rubbed his hand over my head and said, ""Look at this noggin, I rest my case. Boy looks like one of George Washington Carver's experiments sprouted legs and run off. You sure you're not from Tuskegee, Alabama, Bud?"" I said. ""No. sir."" The woman sucked in her lower lip and swallowed a smile before she said, ""See, Bud, he can't help himself. But he really doesn't mean anything, do you, Poppa?"" The way she asked that you'd have to be pretty stupid not to know how to answer her. Lefty Lewis said, ""Not a thing. It's just that you--"" His daughter spoke up. ""My name is Mrs. Sleet, Bud."" ""Pleased to meet you, ma'am."" ""Now, while you wash up I'm going to go get some clothes that my boy outgrew a while ago, barely been used. So when you get dressed you come on down and we'll eat, you chose a great day to visit, we're having a very special breakfast today--pancakes, sausages and toast and a big glass of orange juice. You can meet Scott and Kim, too. How's that sound?"" ""That sounds real good, ma'am. Thank you very much."" ""Don't mention it, it's a pleasure to have such a well- mannered young visitor."" Mrs. Sleet and Lefty Lewis left the room. As soon as they were a little bit down the hall I could hear her start in on scolding her father again. ""I just can't believe it. You know, Momma was right about you. .. ."" All I could hear next was him mumbling some answer, then her slapping his arm again. After I got out of the bathroom, I saw that Mrs. Sleet had put some clean clothes on the bed. My old clothes were gone, all except for my drawers which I hadn't taken off. She'd even put clean drawers out for me so when I put them on I stuck my old ones down in the pocket of my new pants. I could ditch them when I got to Grand Rapids. It's too embarrassing to have strangers look at your dirty drawers, even if the stranger is as nice as Mrs. Sleet. The new clothes were just a little bit too big, but they were long pants and not knickers so I didn't care, I rolled cuffs into the pants and sleeves and they fit pretty doggone good. Man, my first pair of trousers! I let my nose lead me down to where the smell of pancakes and toast was coming from. The Sleets had a room for eating and it had a great big table right in the middle of it. The first thing I noticed was a huge pile of pancakes sitting on a blue and white plate on top of the table. Lefty Lewis was sitting with Mrs. Sleet's kids. The little girl had a big smile and the boy was looking at me kind of hard. It wasn't one of those put-up-your-dukes looks, it was just a look like one dog gives another dog that might be passing through his neighborhood. Lefty Lewis said, ""Bud, these two worrisome midgets are my favorite grandkids. Kim is my favorite grand-daughter and Scott is my favorite grandson. Of course they're my only grandkids, so in fairness you'd have to say they're also my least favorite grandkids"" These two kids had had a lot of practice being around their teasing old granddad because they didn't pay him no mind at all. I said, ""Hi, my name is Bud, not Buddy."" The little girl said, ""That's a strange name, Bud-not- Buddy” and even though she was kind of young and scrawny to be teasing folks I could tell that that was exactly what she was doing. Lefty Lewis laughed and said, ""That's my girl"" then he went into the kitchen. Scott looked up to make sure the grown folks weren't around and said, ""You really run away from home?"" I had to stop and think, it's one thing to lie to a grown-up, most times adults want to hear something that lets them take their attention off you and put it on something else. That makes it easy and not too bad to lie to them. You're really just giving them what they want. It's different when you lie to another kid. Most times kids really do want to know what they're asking you. I guess I'd been thinking too long 'cause he said, ""You run all the way from Grand Rapids to Owosso? Was it 'cause your daddy use to beat you?"" I could answer that with the swear-'fore-God truth. ""Shucks, my daddy never laid a hand on me in his life."" ""Then how come you run?"" ""I didn't like where I was."" That wasn't a lie. ""Well, if you're lying about your daddy beating you, you better scram right after breakfast 'cause my gramps is taking you straight back home."" ""My daddy never laid a hand on me."" The little girl said, ""Scott, you talk too much, let him sit down."" Then she told me, ""Momma's gonna be bringing the sausages in a minute, you like sausages?"" ""Uh-huh."" I'd never had sausages before but if that was what was making the house smell so good I was going to love it. Kim said, ""good, 'cause my grampa brought them all the way from Grand Rapids. He always brings us good food and we're going to share it with you 'cause Momma says you're our special guest and we have to treat you nice. Am I being nice?"" ""So far."" ""Good. I’ll make a deal with you."" Uh-oh. ""What kind of a deal?"" ""I’ll sing a song that I made up all by myself and when I'm done I get to ask you one question and you have to answer and cross your heart you'll tell the truth"" This didn't sound too bad. ""OK."" ""Here goes, it took me a very long time to make this song up, so I hope you like it."" The boy said, ""Oh, brother!"" Kim sang, ""Mommy says no Mommy says no, I listen, you don 't, Wha-ha-ha-ha. The building falls down, The building falls down, You get crushed, I don 't, Wha-ha-ha-ha."" Boy. That was about the worst song I'd ever heard. Kim stood up and bowed like a princess. I clapped my hands together kind of soft under the table. She said, ""Thank you very much."" Scott just shook his head. Kim said, ""OK, that's my part of the deal, now you've got to keep your part and answer any question I ask."" ""OK."" ""Now you can tell me all about how your mother died."" Scott's foot kicked at her under the table. I said, ""Who told you my momma died?"" The little girl said, ""Oops"" and stuffed something from her hand into her mouth. ""My momma got sick. She died real fast. She didn't feel no pain or no suffering."" Kim said, ""I hope my mother never dies."" Scott said, ""Stupid, everybody's got to die."" Kim said, ""Ooh, I'm telling Momma you called me stupid."" He said, ""You do and I’ll tell her that you've got one of those pancakes in the pocket of your dress."" She shut right up. I told her, ""He's right, everybody's got to die. It's not sad unless they do it real slow and suffer. My momma died so quick and painless that she didn't even have time to close her eyes, she didn't even have time to make a face like she was hurting."" Both of Lefty Lewis's grandkids looked real surprised at this news. Mrs. Sleet came into the room with another blue plate, covered with little round pieces of meat. Those had to be the sausages. She saw the way her kids were looking at me with their mouths half opened and said, ""Now you two aren't talking Bud's ear off, are you?"" Scott said, ""No, Momma, I'm not, but Kim's coming real close to."" Kim said, ""I was not, I was just making pleasant conversation."" Mrs. Sleet laughed and set the plate on the table right in Front of me. Lefty Lewis came out with a big glass jug filled with orange juice and sat down next to me. Mrs. Sleet sat down and said, ""Scott and Kim, would you say the grace, please?'' Everyone ducked their heads down and the two kids said, ""God is great, God is good, Let us thank him For our food. Amen. "" Then people started passing the big blue plates around and stabbing toast and pancakes and sausages with their forks. I watched to see how much everyone took and tried to take the same. Then I started to watch how much food the two kids put on their fork every time so I wouldn't look like a pig. Lefty Lewis noticed I was taking a long time and told his daughter, ""See what I told you, Nina, poor Bud-not- Buddy is so skinny and his stomach has shrunk down so much that just smelling the food has got the boy full. Oh, well, I guess that just means more food for the rest of us."" Everyone except for me and Mrs. Sleet yelled a big cheer. Eating with the Sleets and Lefty Lewis was really hard to do, not because they had bad table manners or nothing, but because they talked through the whole breakfast. And they kept trying to get me to talk too. At the Home after grace was said we weren't allowed to say boo. Eating and being quiet is a hard habit to break. Every time one of these Sleets would talk to me and look at me like they expected a answer I’d look around first to make sure no one was watching. At the Home if you got caught talking during mealtime you'd have to get up and leave your food. If these Sleets had to live under those rules they'd all starve to death. They talked after every swallow, they talked after every drink they took, they talked whilst they were wiping off their lips. Shucks, the little girl, Kim, talked with milk running down her throat, some of the time her words got gluggled up in what she was swallowing. And they laughed. Man, did they laugh. It was hard to tell whose story they were laughing at, they were doing so much chattering. Lefty Lewis was talking about radio shows and Scott was talking about going to a baseball game to watch Lefty Lewis pitch and Kim was talking about a little girl she didn't like and Mrs. Sleet was talking about some people called redcaps. Kim said to her mother, ""Mommy, can't you tell that Bud-not-Buddy doesn't know what a redcap is, you gotta explain better."" Mrs. Sleet said, ""Oh, sorry, Bud, redcaps are the men who work at the railroad station loading the trains and taking people's bags to their cars. That's what Mr. Lewis does. My husband is a Pullman porter, he takes care of the people once they're on the trains."" Kim said, ""Yeah, our dad gets to travel all over the country on trains for free!"" Scott said, ""That's 'cause he's working, it's not for free, he gets paid to do it."" Lefty Lewis swallowed a big hunk of sausage and said, ""And you know what, Bud? I bet the thing he misses most is Nina's cooking. I can't tell you how proud I am of how far my daughter's cooking has come. This might be hard to believe, but she used to be such a bad cook that her fried chicken was known to have turned a chicken hawk into a vegetarian."" Scott and Kim and Mrs. Sleet started busting a gut. ""Yup! Lefty Lewis said, ""I brought a friend to Flint a couple of years ago and even though I'd warned him he tried to be polite and ate four of her pancakes. Pour soul held his stomach all the way back to Grand Rapids. Said to me, 'Lefty, I don't mean to show any disrespect, but those weren't pancakes your daughter served me, they were paincakes.' "" Mrs. Sleet laughed along with everyone else and said, ""Well, I'm sure I don't need to hear any more of this"" and picked up the empty sausage plate and went into the kitchen. As soon as she got out of the room Kim whispered, ""Quick, Grampa, tell Budnot-Buddy how many times you had to pull the car over when you two were going back to Grand Rapids so that man could get out and vomick on the side of the road."" Before Lefty Lewis could answer, Mrs. Sleet came out of the kitchen with a big wooden spoon and whopped her father a good lick in the head. AFTER BREAKFAST me and Mr. Lewis said goodbye to the Sleets and got back into the car. I leaned over the front seat to put my suitcase in the back. ""Mr. Lewis, someone stole all the blood last night!"" He said, ""I’ll say one thing for you, Bud, when you go to sleep you go way, way to sleep. You don't remember anything about last night after we got to Flint?"" I said, ""I don't think so, sir."" ""After you so rudely fell asleep on me we dropped the blood off at Hurley Hospital, then I gassed up, then I got in touch with your daddy to let him know you were all right."" Uh-oh. ""What did he say, sir?"" ""I didn't call him, I sent a telegram to the Log Cabin. He still owns that club, doesn't he?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Good."" Lefty Lewis leaned over and reached in the glove box of the car. He pulled out a flimsy piece of yellow paper and handed it to me. Across the top of the paper it said in big letters, WESTERN UNION. Underneath that it said, HEC STOP BUD OK IN FLINT STOP AT 4309 NORTH ST STOP RETURN 8PM WED STOP LEFTY STOP Man! I’ll bet Herman E. Calloway was just as confused by this message as I was. I said, ""What does this mean, sir?"" Lefty Lewis said, ""When you send a telegram the more letters you use the more money you have to pay, so you try to keep your messages as short as you can. Here, let me see it."" I handed him the paper. He said, ""OK, 'HEC,' that stands for your dad, Herman E. Calloway. 'Bud OK in Flint,' that lets him know how far you got and that you're safe. And you did get pretty far, Bud, maybe he won't be too hard on you when he sees how resourceful you were at running away. I know I'd've been darn proud of one of my kids if they'd've gotten that far, but I used to offer them money to run and they'd never take it. ""'At 4309 North St,' that's my daughter's address. And 'Return 8PM Wed' lets him know I'm bringing you home by eight tonight."" I said, ""What are all of those 'stops,' sir?"" He said, ""That's the telegram office's way of saying 'period.' It just means that the sentence is over."" Lefty Lewis spent most of the day doing errands all around Flint. He made me promise to wait in the car for him. I was good and happy when he said, ""That's it, Bud, time to head home."" We drove past that sign that said WELCOME TO FLINT on one side when he looked up and said, ""Uh-oh."" Suddenly a siren went off sounding like it was in the backseat of the car. I raised my head up to look over the seat out the back window. Uh-oh was right! There was a Flint police car right behind us with the red light on top of his roof flashing on and off, on and off, and with the sheen blasting. They'd found me! Shucks, this doggone FBI was just as good as the movies said it was, they were just like those Royal Canadian Mountain Police, they always got their man! I crouched down as low as I could. Lefty Lewis pulled the car over to the side of the road and said real calm and real slow, ""Bud. It's very important that you listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you and that you do exactly as I say"" He kept his eyes stuck on the rearview mirror. By the way he was acting I was starting to think that maybe Lefty Lewis was on the lam too. And wait a minute, how come this man didn't have a real name? Whoever heard of someone's momma naming him Lefty? That name had alias writ all over it! Lefty sounds like a real good name for a stick-up man. It seemed like it would be real easy for Machine Gun Kelly to point at some poor slob and say,' ""That's the guy what ratted me out, Lefty. Finish him off!"" And what he just said about listening carefully and doing exactly what he said was Number 8 of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 8 Whenever a Adult Tells You to Listen Carefully and Talks to You in a Real Calm Voice Do Not Listen, Run as Fast as You Can Because Something Real Terrible Is Just Around the Corner. Especially If the Cops Are Chasing You. I stared at Lefty Lewis, keeping my fingers crossed that the next thing he said wouldn't be ""You'll never take us alive, copper!"" Instead, he said, ""Bud, are you listening, Bud?"" I had to play along until I got a chance to make a break. I said, ""Yes, sir."" ""Attaboy. First close your mouth. Good. Now I want you to take the box that is next to me and quickly put it all the way beneath your seat."" I picked up a box that was about the size of a big thick book and slid it under my seat. Lefty Lewis said, ""Good boy. Now stay put and don't say anything."" He winked at me and said, ""Don't worry, it's all right."" He opened his door and walked back to the police car. I tried to decide what to do. If I made a break for it I was sure the coppers would plug me, but maybe Lefty Lewis would rassle the gun away before they got a good shot off. Or maybe, just maybe Lefty Lewis would take a bullet for me. OK, I told myself, I'ma count to ten, then I'm going to reach into the backseat, snatch my suitcase and hook out for those buildings. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. OK, I'm gonna count to ten again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. OK, this time I'm really, really going to grab that doggone ... The cop and Lefty Lewis were standing at the door. The cop said, ""I want to take a look in the trunk."" Him and Mr. Lewis went around to the back and the hunk opened and I heard someone rumbling around in it. I heard a loud bang and nearly jumped out of my seat. Whew! It was only Mr. Lewis closing the trunk. They walked back to the driver's door. The policeman looked in the backseat and said, ""What's in the suitcase?"" Mr. Lewis said, ""Those are Bud's things. He was visiting here in Flint and I'm taking him home to Grand Rapids."" The policeman looked at me and said, ""Oh. Your grandson, huh? You two look just alike."" Lefty Lewis said, ""Why, thank you, Officer, I always thought the boy was unusually handsome."" The cop didn't have a good sense of humor, he said, ""All right, you're free to go. We can't be too careful, I don't know if you've heard, but we're having a lot of trouble in the factories here. We've been stopping all cars we don't recognize. There've been reports that some more of those stinking labor organizers might be sneaking up here from Detroit."" Mr. Lewis said, ""You don't say."" The cop said, ""Drive carefully"" and he touched the brim of his cop hat the way a cowboy in the moving pictures does. Lefty Lewis got in the car, started it and we pulled back out on the highway. He made a scary face at me and said, ""Bud, this has really been a couple of lucky days for you. First I save you from being eaten by some vampires in Owosso, then you seem to have survived my daughter's pancakes and finally that police officer saves you from the feared and loathsome labor organizers of Detroit! You are truly blessed."" Lefty Lewis was back to acting normal, but I kept wondering who was in the box he didn't want the cop to see. I said, ""What's a labor organizer, sir?"" Mr. Lewis said, ""In Flint they are people who are trying to get unions in the automobile factories."" Before I had a chance to get my next question in Lefty Lewis said, ""I'ma save your breath for you, Bud. I’ll bet the next thing out of your mouth was going to be, 'What's a union,' right?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""A union is like a family, it's when a group of workers get together and try to make things better for themselves and their children."" ""That's all, sir?"" ""That's all."" ""Then why are the cops after them?"" ""That's a very good question. Look in that box you put under your seat."" I pulled the box out and put it in my lap and looked over at Lefty Lewis. He looked back at me and checked the rearview mirror. ""Go ahead."" I stopped for a second. Maybe there was a loaded and cocked pistol hiding in the box, maybe Lefty Lewis would've shot it out with the cop if he'd tried to take us to jail. I started raising the top off the box, and just as I was about to get it open Lefty Lewis moved a lot faster than you'd think somebody's granddad could and slapped his hand on top of it closing it back tight. Uh-oh. Maybe this was loot from a bank that him and Al Capone had knocked over! Maybe Lefty Lewis would have to rub me out if I saw what was inside! Maybe if I looked I'd know too much! He said, ""Before you look, Bud, you've got to understand that what's in there is very dangerous."" I said, ""Well, sir, I really don't think I need to see it, sir. I think I'll just look out the window until we get to Grand Rapids, or maybe ..."" I gave a big fake yawn. ""Maybe I’ll take a nap."" He laughed and said, ""Ah, you're a lot smarter than you look, Bud, you know it would've been curtains for us if that copper would've seen what's in there."" He tapped the top of the box. All I could say was, ""Yes, sir."" He said, ""Go ahead and open it. Bud. You have to promise--no, you have to swear that you won't breathe a word about what you see to anyone” ""Mr. Lewis, sir, I'd really rather take a nap."" ""Well, first open the box."" I took in a big gulp of air and started to raise the top off the box again. Lefty Lewis yelled, ""Bud!"" I jumped so high I nearly banged my head on the roof of the car. I yelled back, ""Yes, sir?"" ""I didn't hear you swear to keep your lips locked."" ""Aw, shucks, Mr. Lewis, I swear, but I'd feel a lot better if I could take a doggone nap."" I snatched the top off the box and got ready to be scared to death. It was just some paper with writing on it. Maybe the pistol or the loot was under all this paper. I kept lifting paper until I got to the bottom of the box. Nothing! I looked at Lefty Lewis. He said, ""I warned you, pretty dangerous, isn't it?"" I must've missed something. I went through the box again. ""How's some paper dangerous, sir?"" ""Read it."" I took one of the papers out, it said: ATTENTION RAILROAD WORKERS THE NEWLY FORMED GRAND RAPIDS BRANCH OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF PULLMAN PORTERS WILL BE HOLDING AN INFORMATIONAL MEETING ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 23, 1936. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES PLEASE COME TO 2345 COLDBROOK AT 9:00. REFRESHMENTS WILL BE SERVED. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST— PLEASE KEEP THIS AS CONFIDENTIAL AS POSSIBLE. It was starting to make sense. I said, ""Mr. Lewis, are you one of those labor organizers?"" He laughed. ""Not really, Bud. I'm picking these up so we can pass them out in Grand Rapids. We've been negotiating to get a union for the Pullman porters for years now and nowhere in Grand Rapids will print these flyers for us. The only place that would do them is all the way in Flint. You were running away to a pretty hot town, young man."" ""Wow !"" ""That trouble the policeman was talking about at the factory is called a sitdown strike. Instead of walking in front of the plant with signs the people who are on strike just sit down on their job. That way the bosses can't bring other people in to steal their jobs. They're going to sit there until the company gives them a union, so the company is trying everything they can think of to get them out. That's why I said those flyers are so dangerous. The people who run the factories and the railroads seemed to be really scared. To them if a worker has any dignity or pride he can't be doing a good job."" BOY, THESE AUTOMOBILES were great for making you conk out! Between the car floating real soft down the road and Lefty Lewis's boring stories about the railroad and the union and baseball I was out cold in no time. When I woke up I looked out the window and stretched. Lefty Lewis said, ""I was about to take you to Butterworth Hospital, I thought you'd left the earth for good."" He pointed out of the window and said, ""Looking familiar?"" Uh-oh. ""Yes, sir."" I pointed at a gasoline filling station and said, ""Yup, there's the gasoline filling station."" He said, ""I guess your daddy would have to burn premium in that big Packard, wouldn't he? I don't think those big engines can run on ethyl gasoline."" I said, ""No, sir, that's right."" He told me, ""Well, you and your daddy sure have one beautiful machine."" I was getting real nervous but I said, ""Thank you, sir."" We turned another corner and my heart started jumping around in my stomach. Halfway down the street was a building that looked like it was made out of giant chopped-down trees. The Log Cabin! Uh-oh. Right outside the place was a sign that said, APPEARING FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY IN JULY HERMAN E. CALLOWAY AND THE NUBIAN KNIGHTS OF THE NEW DEAL. My father had joined a new band! Lefty Lewis pulled up next to a car that was as long as a big boat. He said, ""Ah, there's the Packard, he's here. I had to think real fast. I couldn't let Mr. Lewis and Herman E. Calloway talk to each other. If they did I'd be on the first thing smoking back to Flint. And besides, I felt kind of bad about lying to Mr. Lewis, I wished I didn't have to. Lefty Lewis cut the car off and pulled the key out of the dashboard. I said, ""Mr. Lewis, this is going to be very embarrassing for me."" ""What is, Bud?"" ""Can I go talk to my father by myself, sir? I swear I’ll turn myself in to him."" Lefty Lewis looked at me kind of hard. ""Well, Bud, I don't mean to sully your reputation, but you just ran away from that man all the way across the state, I think I'd better hand-deliver you."" ""But Mr. Lewis, sir, I need to explain it to him by my self. I promise I’ll go in and not run away again."" Lefty Lewis looked out of the windshield like he was thinking. He reached back across the seat and put his hand on the twine keeping my suitcase together. He said, ""I’ll tell you what, Bud, you don't go anywhere without this, do you?"" I said, ""No, sir."" ""OK, here's the deal, I’ll give you""-he looked at his wristwatch--""five minutes to talk to your dad alone. If you're not back by then I’ll bring your bag in for you."" It wasn't great, but it would have to do. Besides, it gave me some more time to think. ""Please promise that you won't look inside of it, sir."" He raised his hand. ""You've got my word."" I got out of the car and walked to the front of the Log Cabin. The doors looked like they were made out of chopped-down trees just like the rest of the building. I looked back at Lefty Lewis and he was still watching so I opened one of the doors. I knew it was one of those doors that Momma had been talking about. I walked in to see what was going to happen. Shucks, there was another set of regular doors inside. The front door closed behind me and I was in the dark. I tried the other door and it came open but I didn't push it all the way in. I waited, then went back out to get my bag. I walked over to the driver's side of Lefty Lewis's car, smiled and said, ""Thank you very much, sir. He's in there, he was so glad to see me that I'm not even in a whole lot of trouble. He's real busy right now and told me to tell you thank you very much and that he'd get a hold of you."" Lefty Lewis smiled too. ""Well, he might be happy now, but if I know anything about your daddy I expect you're gonna be having problems sitting down before this night's over. ""Now I know he's going to tell you this but I gotta add my two cents. Son, there just aren't too many places a young Negro boy should be traveling by himself, especially not clear across Michigan, there're folks in this state that make your average Ku Kluxer look like John Brown. You know who John Brown is?"" ""Uh-uh, no, sir."" ""That's all right, he's out there moldering somewhere. But the point is you were very lucky this time. You've got to be good and stay put. I know your dad's not the easiest man in the world but, believe me, he's mellowed a lot from when it was just him and your sister. ""The next time you're of a mind to do a little traveling you come on down to the train station and ask for Lefty Lewis first. I won't tell anyone, but we need to talk before you set out on your own again. Lefty Lewis. Think you can remember that name?"" ""Lefty Lewis."" Well, at least he was using the alias all over and not just with me and his family in Flint. He handed my bag out of the window. ""OK, get back an in there and tell your daddy I said hello."" ""Thank you, Mr. Lewis."" I stood waving until the big car turned out into the street. I sucked in a jumbo gulp of air and opened the front door again. This time I pushed the second set of doors open and walked in. It was dark but I could see that there were six men sitting in a circle on a little stage at the other end of the room. One of them was white. Five of the men had their eyes on the other guy. One of them had drumsticks in his hands and was leaned over softly tapping out a rhythm on the wooden stage floor. Three of them were drinking from bottles of pop, and one, a real old one, was using a rag to wipe the inside of a trumpet. The guy who had to be my father was sitting with his back to me wearing a hat. He was talking just like me! And it didn't take much listening to tell he was lying, or at least doing some real good exaggerating, just like I do! That was all the proof I needed. His voice was a lot rougher and more tired-sounding than I thought it would be. He leaned back in his chair. ""That's right, after I won the Golden Gloves no one couldn't tell me I wasn't going to be middleweight champ within two, three years tops."" The drummer stopped tapping. ""Middleweight? What, this was so long ago gravity wasn't as strong as it is now, or did a pound just weigh less back then?"" The others laughed but my dad didn't let it bother him. ""That's right, middleweight. You got to keep in mind that I had more hair and fewer pounds back then."" He pulled the hat off and rubbed his hands over his glass-smooth head. My dad shaved his hair! That was something I always wanted to do too! He said, ""My manager goes and lines up a bout against a fighter outta Chicago by the name of Jordan 'Snaggletooth' MacNevin. ""From the name I'm expecting some young Irish kid with bad teeth but this guy was one of us and so old that he could have been a waiter at the Last Supper. ""When the fight began I wasn't about to show mercy, you understand?"" All the guys onstage were nodding. ""And to make a long story longer I go out and dick this halfway stiff right jab clean at Pops's head and--"" The horn guy said, ""Herman, to this day I can't believe you swung at that old man."" ""What was I supposed to do, Jimmy? I wasn't trying to kill him or nothing, I just wanted to put him down quick and quiet."" Jimmy went, ""Uh, uh, uh ..."" ""And the next thing I know I'm watching my mouth- piece and my chance to be champ flying out of the ring into the fourth row of seats. I ain't never been hit so hard in my life."" The drummer said, ""What, you lost one fight and quit?"" Then Herman E. Calloway said the words that let me know I was right. I felt like someone had cut a light on inside me. I knew it'd been right for me to come all the way from Flint to Grand Rapids to find my dad. The idea that had started as a teeny-weeny seed in a suitcase was now a mighty maple. Herman E. Calloway, my father, said, ""There comes a time when you're doing something and you realize it just doesn't make any sense to keep on doing it, you ain't being a quitter, it's just that the good Lord has seen fit to give you the sense to know, you understand, enough is enough."" That was the exact same thought I'd had when I got whipped by Teddy boy! Only two folks with the same blood would think them just alike! I sucked in a big gulp of air, got a good grip on my suitcase and walked into the light of the stage. The old horn guy, Jimmy, saw me first and said, ""I thought I heard that door open. Did Miss Thomas send you, son?"" I just kept walking onto the stage. I had to see my father's face, I knew we'd look so much alike that the truth would hit him as hard as that Snaggletooth guy had. Even Lefty Lewis said he could tell me and Herman E. Calloway were kin. He turned to see who Jimmy was talking to and my mighty maple started shaking in the wind. My dad's face was old. My dad's face was real old, just like this horn guy. Maybe too old. But ... there was just too much proof that this was my father! He smiled at me. He had his arms crossed over a great big stomach with his head-wiping rag hanging out of his right hand. The first thing my dad said to me was, ""Well, well, well, little man, what brings you here? Miss Thomas?"" ""I don't know any Miss Thomas, sir."" ""So what're you doing here?"" He put his hand over his eyes to shield them from the stage lights and looked out into the dark part of the bar. I noticed how wrinkly my dad's hand was. ""Who brought you here? Your folks out there?"" ""No, sir. I'm here to meet my father."" Jimmy said, ""Who's your daddy? Why'd he tell you to meet him here?"" I kept looking at Herman E. Calloway. ""He didn't tell me to meet him here, sir. I come all the way from Flint to meet my daddy for the very first time."" Ah the men looked over at the drummer. He stopped tapping. He said, ""Awww, man. Look, this child ain't no kin of mine. What's your momma's name, boy?"" I said, ""You ain't my daddy."" I pointed right at Herman E. Calloway's big belly. ""You know it's you."" All the eyes jumped over on Herman E. Calloway. He quit smiling and looked at me a lot harder, like he was really noticing me. I knew if I was a regular kid I'd be crying buckets of tears now, I didn't want these men to think I was a baby so I was real glad that my eyes don't cry no more. My nose plugged up and a little growl came out of my mouth but I kept my finger pointed, cleared my throat and said, ""I know it's you."" THE CIRCLE OF MEN got very quiet. The younger guys looked like they wanted to laugh but were afraid to and the Jimmy guy and the man who must be my father were looking at me that way grown-ups do when they're getting ready to give you some bad news or when they're trying to decide which hand they're going to smack you upside the head with. Finally Jimmy snapped his fingers and said, ""Hold on now, is your name Bud?"" He knew my name! I said, ""Yes, sir!"" Jimmy said, ""Herman! don't you see'' This has something to do with that crazy telegram you got this morning."" He looked back at me. ""And you said you're from Flint, Bud?'' ""Yes, sir, that's right, that's right where I'm from!"" Herman E. Calloway said. ''What in Sam Hill is going on here? First off, don't you be coming in here accusing folks of being your father, and second off, where is your mother?"" Shucks, he said it like he didn't already know. I said, ""She's dead, sir, she died four years ago."" Herman E. Calloway said, ""I am truly sorry to hear that, but it's obvious that you are a disturbed young man and you don't have a clue who your father is. You just tell us who's looking after you now, and we'll get you sent back to wherever it is you belong."" ""I belong with you now, sir."" Herman E. Calloway said, ""Now you look here ..."" Jimmy said, ""Hold on, Herman."" He seemed a lot nicer than this Calloway guy. ""Bud, you got to understand Mr. Calloway here can't be your daddy, no how, no way, nuh-uh. I don't know what gave you that idea, but whatever, we've got to get you back home. Someone in Flint's got to be worried sick about you."" I said, ""No, sir, I don't have nobody left in Flint, that's why I came all the way here."" He said, ""No one, no one at all?"" I said, ""No, sir."" He said, ""No brothers?"" ""No, sir."" ""No sisters?"" ""No, sir."" ""What about an auntie?"" ""No, sir” ""No grandma?"" ""No, sir."" Shucks, it looked like this guy was going to go over my whole family tree, but he whistled and said, ""So were you living in an orphanage?"" Uh-oh, I had to be careful how I answered this, one wrong answer and I could tell that these guys were ready to give me up to the cops or give me a one-way ticket back to the Home. I said, ""Well, sir, I had some problems with some folks that were supposed to be looking after me and after I hid their shotgun and poured water all over Todd Amos I busted out of the shed and had to go on the lam and then I thought it was about time I came and met my father because it's been--"" He raised his hand to stop me. ""That's fine, son, but just answer what I asked you. What orphanage were you in?"" ""Well, sir, I used to be in a Home and then I wasn't and then I was with some people that were kind of mean and then I tried to find Miss Hill but she moved all the way to Chicago and that was too far to walk so--"" He raised his hand again to shut me up. ""Hold on, Bud. Do me a favor, go wait by that door for a minute."" He pointed to the side of the stage. I walked over and waited to see what was going to happen. I tried pushing the door open a little bit in case I had to make a quick escape but it was jammed tight. I'd have to leave out of the same door I came in. The man named Jimmy and the guy who had to be my daddy started whispering. After while Herman E. Calloway raised his arms and said, ""Hey. But don't forget, this is your little red wagon, you pull it if you want."" Jimmy said, ""Fair enough."" He waved me back onto the stage. ""Bud"" he said, ""you look like you might be a little hungry, so I’ll tell you what we're going to do. We're all done rehearsing and were about to head over to the Sweet Pea. You're invited to come along under one condition."" ""What, sir?"" ""Once you get something in your belly you've got to be straight with me, you've got some explaining to do, we'll feed you but you've got to tell us the truth. Do we have a deal?"" He stuck his hand out for me to shake. But I wanted to know what I was getting myself into. ""What's the Sweet Pea, sir?"" ""Best restaurant in Grand Rapids. Is it a deal?"" I don't know how grown-ups can tell I'm always so doggone hungry but I sure wasn't going to turn down getting my very first real restaurant food. I grabbed his hand and made sure I gave it a hard squeeze like Momma told me to and said, ""Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."" He smiled. ""No problem."" Herman E. Calloway said, ""Well, James, like I said, if he's gonna be doing some explaining it's got to be to you, I don't need to listen to this scamp's nonsense whilst I'm trying to digest my supper."" He stuck a pipe that wasn't lit into his mouth and walked off the stage. Shucks, if my father had to be so doggone old I was starting to wish that Lefty Lewis or this Jimmy guy were him, Herman E. Calloway seemed like he was going to be hard to get along with. The horn player said, ""Little man, my name is Jimmy Wesley, you can call me Mr. Jimmy."" ""Yes, sir"" He pointed at the younger men. ""The drummer there is Doug 'the Thug' Tennant, the sax man is Harrison Eddie 'Steady' Patrick..."" The saxophone player said, ""Awww, man, it's not Ed- die Steady, it's Steady Eddie, Steady Eddie Patrick."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Uh-huh, and on trombone we have Chug 'Doo-Doo Bug' Cross, and the palest member of the band, on piano, is Roy 'Dirty Deed' Breed."" He shook his head again and said, ""Lord knows why these young musicians can't just leave the perfectly good names their mommas gave them alone, but for some reason they can't. Anyway, fellas, this here is Bud ... what was your last name, Bud?"" ""Caldwell, sir."" ""This here's Bud Caldwell. He's gonna be our guest over at the Sweet Pea for dinner. Y'all say hello to the little man and make him feel comfortable."" The Thug said, ""What's the word, Bud?"" Dirty Deed said, ""How you doing?"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""Welcome, little stuff."" Steady Eddie said, ""Good to meet you, my man."" I said, ""Pleased to meet you."" Mr. Jimmy told them, ""All right. He'll ride over with you four, me and Herm will meet you there."" The sax man, Steady Eddie, said, ""All right, Mr. Jimmy, we'll finish loading up."" The Jimmy guy went out the front door. The sax man told me, ""Come on, little man, if Mr. Jimmy's gonna spring for your supper the least you can do is help load the car. Grab that case over there and put it in the trunk of the Buick out back."" He pointed to a long skinny black suitcase that had a leather handle on top of it and said, ""And be careful, that's my bread and butter in there."" I must have looked confused because he told me, ""That's my horn, my ax, my saxophone, the thing I make all my money with, so don't get butterfingers and drop it."" I said, ""Oh. Yes, sir."" The trombone man, Doo-Doo Bug, said, ""One thing you are going to have to drop, though, is all that stuff. The only two folks around here old enough for you to be calling them sir are Mr. Jimmy and""--he winked--""your long-lost dear old daddy."" The whole band busted a gut laughing. The Thug guy said, ""I'ma let you in on a little secret, my man. I think the only reason Mr. C. is denying he's your daddy is 'cause you went and hurt his feelings."" ""How? I didn't do nothing to him."" ""There it is, that's just what I mean. Here you two are getting together for the first time and you didn't show the man no love."" He looked over at Doo-Doo Bug. ""Bug, did you see any love being passed from this boy to his daddy?"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""You leave me out of your nonsense,"" The Thug kept going. ""Shoot, man, seems to me like you should give the man his props, seems to me like you should've given the man a whole lot more affection. ""You see, I know Mr. C. better than most folks do, I know that beneath that coldhearted, evil, wicked, nasty, mean--"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""Don't forget cheap, cheap's got to be in there somewhere."" The Thug said, ""You know cheap's right up high on the list. But as I was saying, beneath all that festering nastiness is a tender, kind, loving human being. Why, I'd bet you dollars to doughnuts that he's outside right now sitting in that Packard sobbing openly about how you shunned him. ""When you get to the Sweet Pea, rush right up on him, give him a big hug, yell out 'Daddy,' then plant a big juicy kiss right on the top of his shiny bald head. Shoot, you do that and you'll be in his will so quick your head will spin."" I put this Thug guy on my list of people not to pay any mind to. Herman E. Calloway seemed like the kind of person that would rather get bit in the behind by a snaggletooth mule than have somebody give him a kiss. Steady Eddie said, ""Let's not get the little man killed before he's had a chance to eat, Thug. Son, I hope you've got sense enough to let what he's telling you to go in one ear and find the nearest exit. You just steer clear of Mr. C. for a while, he's not someone you want to toy with, and for God's sake whatever you do don't call him Daddy or Poppa or anything that's going to give anyone the idea you two are kin, you hear?"" These guys really thought I was dumb. I said, ""Yes, sir. But isn't it just like my luck to come clean across the state to find my daddy and he turns out to be a mean old coot?"" I slapped my hand over my mouth, I knew better than saying something like this out loud but it just fell out of my mouth before I could swallow it down. This was Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself Number 63. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 63 Never, Ever Say Something Bad About Someone You Don't Know--Especially When You're Around a Bunch of Strangers. You Never Can Tell Who Might Be Kin to That Person or Who Might Be a Lip-Flapping, Big-Mouth Spy. Sure enough, the drummer, the Thug guy, started acting like he was writing stuff down on a piece of pretend paper. He said, ""Let's see, was that 'mean old coot' or 'old mean coot'? Shoot, baby, if I drop some info like this on Mr. C. I might be able to stay in this band longer than the last three drummers did. You see, kid, you ain't the only one trying to get on Mr. C's good side, this is the best drumming gig in the state and I need to hang on to it as long as I can."" I wasn't sure if this drummer guy really was a dirty dog or if he was just a big teaser. Whichever way, I'd have to work real hard on remembering Rule and Thing Number 68. Or was it 63? Steady Eddie said, ""Thug, you're gonna have to lay off the kid's chops, the little man's got problems enough and he sure don't need to have you meddling with him. Let's get that car loaded, me and ... what's your name again, kid?"" ""Bud, not Buddy, si ...just Bud, not Buddy."" ""Right, me and Bud-not-Buddy are too dang hungry to hear any more of your lip."" Of all the Dusky Devastators of the Depression or the Nubian Knights, Steady Eddie is my favorite. We loaded a bunch of funny-shaped black suitcases into the trunk of a big old black Buick, then climbed in. I got in the backseat and sat between Dirty Deed and Steady Eddie with my suitcase on my lap. Doo- Doo Bug got behind the steering wheel and the Thug got in beside him. The Thug said, ""So, Bud-not-Buddy, I'ma come right out and ask what's on everyone else's mind. How'd you find out Mr. C. was your daddy?"" ""My mother let me know."" Thug said, ""Uh, I ain't trying to be funny, and I'd never play the dozens on no one, but let me ask you, was your momma, uh, how can I put this? Was your momma as old as sand when she had you?"" Steady Eddie said, ""Man, leave the kid alone, you got no call to go prying into his life."" I never minded talking about my momma so I told the Thug, ""Yes, sir, she was pretty old when I was born."" Thug said, ""Shoot, I knew she had to be either old or crazy to have anything to do with that man. How old was she, eighty, and was she blind?"" I said, ""No, sir, she was old, but her eyes didn't go bad yet. She was twenty when I was born, and she was twenty-six when she died."" That news always kills any conversation you're having with grown folks. The Dusky Devastators got as quiet as some mice with bedroom slippers on. The only sound you could hear for a second was the keys cling- clang-clinging up against the metal dashboard as Doo- Doo Bug turned the car into the front of a little house that had a sign saying THE SWEET PEA on it. The Thug said, ""Things is hard all over, ain't they?"" Steady Eddie said, ""You're all right, little man, you're a tough little nut, I like that. Most folks your age would be bawling their eyes out if they got teased as hard as that fool drummer was teasing you, but you ain't even close to crying, are you?"" I said, ""No, sir, I don't know why, but my eyes don't cry no more."" Steady Eddie said, ""I like that, ‘my eyes don't cry no more.' You mind if I borrow that? That sounds like a great name for a song."" I said, ""No, sir, I don't mind at all."" He reached over and rubbed his hand over my head and said, ""Yeah, you're all right, little fella. And don't you worry none too much about the Thug, Mr. C. changes drummers the way most folks change their drawers. What you see in that front seat is a man on borrowed time."" Thug said, ""Awww, man, what did you hear?"" Doo-Doo Bug cut the car off and said, ""All right. gentlemen, that's enough, let's go stuff our craws."" WHEN WE GOT into the restaurant I could see that it was someone's living room that they'd set about ten card tables and some folding chairs in. Every table but one was filled and there were five or six people standing in the doorway waiting to sit down. We said, ""Excuse us"" and walked right past. Then the smell of the place got into my nose and I could tell why folks were lining up to get in. I closed my eyes and took in a big snort of air. It was like someone took a old pot and poured about a hundred gallons of hot apple cider and a hundred gallons of hot coffee into it, then stirred eight or nine sweet potato pies, crusts and all, into that, then let six big steamy meat loafs float on top of all that, then threw in a couple of handfuls of smashed potatoes, then boiled the whole thing on high. This must be exactly how heaven smells! I could tell by the smell that Mr. Jimmy was telling the truth when he said this was the best restaurant in Grand Rapids. Shucks, I've never eaten in one before but I'd say this was the best restaurant in the world! I opened my eyes 'cause the smell was starting to get me dizzy. On the other side of the room Herman E. Calloway was sitting at a table with Mr. Jimmy and a woman. Steady Eddie pointed at the only empty table, one that had a sign saying RESERVED NBC On top of it, and said, ""That's where we're at, over there, Bud. NBC stands for 'Nobody but Calloway,' Mr. C. changes the name of the band so much that no one can keep up with the new names so they call us NBC so's they don't have to change the sign."" Before I could sit down with them Mr. Jimmy saw us and said, ""Here they are"" and pointed at me and waved for me to come over to their table. Shucks, I'd rather sit with the band than with Herman E. Calloway, it would be hard to have a good time eating if you looked up and saw him every time you took a bite. The Thug said, ""Remember what I said"" pointed at the top of his head and acted like he was smacking some kisses. I walked to the other table. Mr. Jimmy said, ""Bud, this here's Miss Thomas, she's our vocal stylist."" She could tell I didn't know what that meant so she said, ""I'm the singer, honey."" I said, ""Pleased to meet you, ma'am."" She laughed and stuck her hand out for me to shake. There were about nine diamond rings on just her right hand! She said, ""Oh, my, a gentleman. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance as well."" Then she took all those ringed-up fingers and rubbed them across my cheek, held my chin and said, ""Come here, child,"" and pulled my face up close to hers. Uh-oh, I twisted up my face to get ready for a kiss but instead she looked real close at me and said, ""What's this; baby?"" She rubbed her fingers over a couple of sting spots that I'd been scratching. For a second I was going to tell her they were vampire bites, but something told me to tell the truth this time. I said, ""That's just some hornet stings, ma'am, I got bit up when the Amoses locked me in their shed."" It was her turn to twist her face up. ""When who locked you up in what shed?"" 'They were the people the Home was paying to look after me. I got bit by their fish-head guards."" I showed the woman the bite on my hand. I was surprised to see it was puffing out from pus. ""My Lord!"" she said. ""Herman, this child's hand is infected. None of you men noticed how he looks?"" Herman E. Calloway said, ""Talk to James, far as I know he's the only one who looked at the kid."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Well, Grace, to be truthful I did think the boy's face was a little swollen up, but you know how dark it is in the Cabin, and, by God, there are some folks who just naturally have lopsided heads."" She said, ""Dark or not, even blind Lemon Jefferson could see something's wrong with this baby's eye. What happened here, Bud?"" She touched underneath my eye as light as a feather. I said, ""Well, ma'am, Todd Amos woke me up by shoving a pencil up my nose all the way to the R and when I went to punch him I slapped him instead and it left a big welt on his cheek so we put up our dukes and went at it and it didn't take long before I knew I couldn't whip him so I just curled up and fell down"" I looked at Herman E. Calloway to make sure he was listening to the next part. I wanted to let him know that even though he was real mean our minds thought about things in the exact same way. I said, ""I fell down, ma'am, 'cause the Lord give me the good sense to know when enough is enough” He acted like he didn't hear. So I kept talking to Miss Thomas. ""Then Mrs. Amos came and I could tell they'd gone through my suitcase even though they promised they wouldn't and she locked me up in the shed where those hornets and fish-head guards got a hold of me."" Miss Thomas looked like this was some real amazing news. Herman E. Calloway said, ""Sounds like a case of diarrhea of the mouth and constipation of the brain."" Miss Thomas gave him a dirty look and said, ""You said 'the Home,' Bud, what kind of a home? Where's your momma?"" I said, ""She died four years ago, ma'am."" She put her hand on my shoulder and said, ""I'm sorry, sweetheart. How 'bout your daddy? Do you know where he's at?"" I said, ""Yes, ma'am."" She said, ""Where is he, honey?"" I pointed dead at Herman E. Calloway's big belly again and said, ""That's him right there."" Miss Thomas looked like she wanted to smile but she said, ""Now, Bud, I've only known you for a couple of minutes but I can tell your momma did a fine job of raising you, I can see you've had a good, proper up-bringing, so I'm kind of surprised that you're pointing like that."" She was right. I brought my finger down. I said, ""I'm sorry, ma'am."" She said, ""That's fine, but it wasn't me who got pointed at."" I told Herman E. Calloway, ""I'm sorry, sir."" But I didn't mean it. She smiled and said, ""That's better, we all make mistakes. You know what, Bud, you look like you could use a good meal, so why don't you sit right there and join us?"" She pointed a ring-covered finger at the empty chair direct across from him. Shucks, how could anyone enjoy their food with Herman E. Calloway staring back at you? But maybe my luck was starting to change. As soon as I sat down, Herman E. Calloway picked up his coffee cup and said, ""If you'll excuse me, this is about where I came in"" and walked over to where the band was sitting. He told them, ""All right. Someone's got to give me their seat and go sit with James and Miss Grace--oh, and my son."" For a second it looked like a stampede of Dusky Devastators of the Depression, they all jumped up at once and started heading for our table. They saw what they'd done, laughed, and Steady Eddie said, ""Take my seat, Mr. C., I wanna talk to that kid, he's got the look of a future sax man about him."" He came over to our table. Miss Thomas asked me, ""Do you mind if I order your supper, Bud?"" I said, ""No, ma'am"". I couldn't believe you got to order what you wanted, I thought you just sat down and they'd bring you whatever was on the stove. A woman came up to the table. She said, ""Y'all ready, Miss Thomas?"" Miss Thomas said, ""We sure are, Tyla."" Tyla said, ""Who's the little fella, did y'all pick up someone new for the band?"" Miss Thomas laughed. ""They're getting younger all the time, aren't they? This here's Bud and he's going to be our guest for a while, so I want to impress him with something special."" Tyla said, ""Well, you know you brought him to the right place. It's nice to meet you, Bud."" I said, ""Pleased to meet you, ma'am."" She said, ""Ma'am? Mercy, Miss Thomas, your guest has some real fine manners. I can tell that he isn't one of those rude, crude folks Mr. Calloway usually scours up."" Steady Eddie said, "" Tyla, I am crushed."" She said, ""Bud, I apologize for mistaking you for a musician."" I told her, ""That's OK, ma'am, no offense taken."" Miss Thomas said, ""Is there any more of that meat loaf left?"" ""Yes, ma'am, sure is."" ""How about some okra and mashed potatoes too, Bud?"" ""Thank you, ma'am."" ""And does a glass of apple cider sound good?"" ""Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am."" ""OK,"" she said, ""I’ll have the same.'' Jimmy ordered a supper that was all the way different from mine and Steady Eddie ordered one that was all the way different from his! No wonder you hear about rich folks going to restaurants once a week, this was great! Miss Tyla went away and Miss Thomas started back on me. ""Bud, I've got to let you know that I'm pretty sure that there's just no way that Mr. C. is your father. Tell me what gave you the idea he was."" ""My mother did, ma'am."" Miss Thomas looked over at Mr. Jimmy real quick, then said, ""Sweetheart, did you know a whole lot of people all over the state know Mr. C., did you know he's pretty famous?"" ""No, ma'am."" ""Ah, well. You know what I think? I think maybe your mother heard him on the radio or heard somebody talking about him or saw the band somewhere and told you that Mr. C. reminded her of your father and you misunderstood what she meant, isn't that possible?"" ""I don't think so, ma'am."" She looked at me for a second, then said, ""Did she come right out and say, 'Your daddy is Herman E. Calloway,' Bud?"" ""Well, almost. But not in words just like that."" ""Then tell me what the words were like, honey."" Uh-oh. It was going to be hard to explain to Miss Thomas about mighty maples and hints from flyers. As long as I kept Herman E. Calloway being my father to myself the whole thing made real good sense, but as soon as I tried to tell other folks about it, it seemed like maybe it was something some stupid kid had dreamed up, like it was wishing and hoping instead of something true and real. I looked down at my suitcase and said, ""Well ..."" And I could tell my luck was changing, before I could say anything else Miss Tyla was at our table with a tray. Miss Thomas reached across the table, patted my hand and said, ""We'll talk tomorrow, Bud, I bet you're sick and tired of answering people's questions, aren't you?"" I said, ""Yes, ma'am, I am."" But I did notice that she'd said ""tomorrow."" That might mean they weren't going to try to send me back to Flint right away! Miss Tyla said, ""Miss Thomas,"" and set a plate in front of her, then said, ""Mr. Jimmy"" and gave him some food too, then said, ""Steady"" and put his plate down so that it rattled a little, then said, ""And finally, the young gentleman"" and put a plate crammed with food in front of me! It was the best meal I'd ever had, and when it was done Miss Tyla brought me a dessert she called ""On the House."" It was a piece of warm sweet potato pie with some white fluffy stuff called whipped cream swopped all over the top of it. After I shoved the last crumbs of pie in my mouth and scraped up the last little dribbles of whipped cream, I looked around at the people at my table and I couldn't help breaking out in a big smile. I didn't see it before, but now that I looked I could tell that Miss Thomas must be the most beautiful woman in the world. When she talked she moved her hands and fingers around and the lights from the ceiling and from the little candle on the table would bounce off all them diamonds and spark up in your eye and make you feel like you'd been hit with some kind of magic fairy dust, then you couldn't help but smile. All the while she'd hum too, but hum doesn't seem like it's the right word for what she was doing. Most times I'd heard humming before it was just a excuse for not being able to sing or something people'd do if they didn't know the words to a song. Uh-uh, that doesn't fit the sounds Miss Thomas was making, you couldn't help but look up and wonder if this was a real human being that was making these sounds. What her humming reminded me most of was that feeling you get when you walk barefoot on a railroad track and, for a long time before you can see it, you can feel the train coming right through the bottoms of your feet. Her humming started slow and easy at first, but then, just like you could feel that train shakea-shake- a-shaking from somewhere far off, after while Miss Thomas's humming made you feel like something big and strong was passing right by you and everything on you was getting rattly and shaky and about to get shook loose. It made you want to drop your fork and grab hold of something solid. From hearing just this little bit of humming I could understand why Mr. Jimmy didn't call her a singer, singer wasn't a big enough word to take in the kind of music that was jumping out of Miss Thomas's chest. And I didn't notice before how funny Mr. Jimmy was. The stories he was telling about traveling around the country with Herman E. Calloway had us all laughing so much that even the nosy people at all the tables near ours quit eating and were busting their guts and throwing their two cents into the stories. The only table that was quiet was where the Dusky Devastators were sitting. It seemed like Herman E. Calloway could make it so you just wanted to sit and watch your hands with a sad look on your face. And I hadn't noticed before how nice Steady Eddie was either. He talked out of the side of his mouth and kept his eyes kind of blinked halfway down, especially when Miss Tyla would come to our table to see if we were all right, which she did a lot. And he was the first person I'd ever seen who could eat and talk and laugh and drink and sneeze whilst keeping a toothpick dangling out of his mouth, no matter what he'd do that toothpick always stayed dancing just below his mustache. And Steady Eddie took his time to show me how to hold my lips and how to put my fingers like I was really playing a pretend saxophone. I'm not sure exactly when it happened, if it was when I was scraping up the last little drops of melted whipped cream or if it was when Miss Thomas's fingers got to flinging all that magic fairy dust, but sometime whilst I was sitting in the Sweet Pea another seed got to sprouting, sometime in that smells-like-heaven place another mighty maple started digging down its roots and grabbing hold. One second I was laughing my head off and the next second I was feeling very surprised 'cause something hit me just as hard as Snaggletooth MacNevin had smacked Herman E. Calloway. All of a sudden I knew that of all the places in the world that I'd ever been in this was the one. That of all the people I'd ever met these were the ones. This was where I was supposed to be. And Herman E. Calloway could kiss my wrist if he thought he was gonna scare me out of this. It was gonna take more than a grouchy old bald-headed guy with a tremendous belly to run me out of here. I was smiling and laughing and busting my gut so much that I got carried away and some rusty old valve squeaked open in me then -- woop, zoop, sloop -- tears started jumping out of my eyes so hard that I had to cover my face with the big red and white napkin that was on the table. I hadn't been this embarrassed since I woke up and found Mrs. Sleet looking at my legs. I could tell that everyone in the Sweet Pea had stopped laughing and talking and had started looking at me, but I still couldn't quit bawling. Momma used to tell me I'd only get one chance to make a first impression and it looked like I was blowing it with the Dusky Devastators of the Depression. Shucks. Finally I had to put my face in my arms on top of the table and put the napkin over my head like it was a little blanket 'cause, try as hard as I wanted, it didn't look like I was gonna get this doggone valve closed any time soon. I felt Miss Thomas's hand come up under the napkin and rub real soft and slow back and forth over my head. She pulled me out of my chair into her lap and wrapped her arms around me and bounced me up and down on her knee. Dangee, I'd never have any kind of reputation with the band now, the only thing I could do was hang on to the napkin and try to make it so folks wouldn't notice how wet my face was. She said, so quiet that I was the only one who could hear it, ""OK, baby, OK. I know, sweetheart, I know” Then she started humming again and with my ear mashed up against her chest it felt like all my bones and muscles quit doing their jobs, it felt like something as big as a steam locomotive engine was chugchug- chugging right past my ear. I wasn't sure if it was her lips or her hand, but something whispered to me in a language that I didn't have any trouble understanding, it said. ""Go ahead and cry. Bud, you're home."" ""Now, Bud,"" Miss Thomas said, ""This is what we call Grand Calloway Station."" She parked the car in front of a big house and got out so I grabbed my suitcase from the backseat and jumped out too. Even though I was still real embarrassed and quiet about all the crying I'd just been doing at the Sweet Pea I knew I was going to have to start talking sooner or later so I asked her, ""How come this house has got a name, ma' am?"" She said, ""Mr. Calloway said a long time ago that there were so many different people in and out of here at so many different hours of the day and night that it reminded him of that train station in New York City, Grand Central Station. The name kind of stuck."" As soon as we got inside Miss Thomas said, ""I’ll show you around the place tomorrow, tonight it's late and we're all pretty tired, so I’ll take you right up to where you're going to be sleeping."" I followed her up a staircase and we walked down a hall. Miss Thomas opened a door and we went in. On one side there was a bed and a window with some curtains, and on the other side were two little doors. Sitting in the space between the two doors was a chair and a little table like the kind you see in the moving pictures that women use to put lipstick on, it had a long skinny drawer that went across the bottom and a big round mirror stuck right on top. Next to the bed there was a little table with a lamp that had a picture of a skinny little black horse right in the lampshade. Miss Thomas turned on the lamp and the horse got all bright, now I could see he was brown. Miss Thomas said, ""We're going to have to talk to Mr. Calloway about where you can put your things, Bud, I don't think you'll be able to fit anything in those closets."" She pointed at the two little doors. ""There're a lot of old things in there that he really needs to clear out. For now just put your suitcase there."" She pointed at the table with the mirror on it. I said, ""Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am."" She smiled and said, ""OK, I guess that's it. The first door in the hall on the left is my room, the second door is Mr. Calloway's, and the door on the right is the bathroom. Do you think you'll be all right?"" I would, except that those two little doors were starting to make me nervous. They looked like they were just the right size for a young Frankenstein or wolfman to come busting out of once all the grown folks left the room, and since there was only one chair in the room I wouldn't be able to block both of the doors off. I said, ""I’ll probably be OK, ma'am, but there's one thing I'm wondering about."" ""What's that, sweetheart?"" I pointed at the doors and said, ""Are those locked?"" I was going to have to try to make a better first impression on Miss Thomas, she had to think I was pretty babyish what with me crying my eyes out before and now being scared of some little monster-size doors. She laughed and said, ""I don't think they're locked, Bud, there's nothing in there but girl's clothes and toys."" I said, ""Won't the girl get mad if she comes back in here and I'm sleeping in her bed?"" Miss Thomas waited a second like she had to think. She finally said, ""No, Bud, I don't think you have to worry about that, she's gone."" Uh-oh! That was two things to get nervous about in one sentence! The first thing to worry about was Rules and Things number 547, or something, that was the one about when a adult tells you, ""Don't worry."" The second bad thing was Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself Number 28, that was a real short one: RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 28 Gone = dead! I don't know why grown folks can't say someone is dead, they think it's a lot easier to say ""gone."" That meant I was going to have to spend the night in the room of a little dead girl, that meant I wasn't going to be getting much sleep at all. I could jam the chair up against the one door's knob, and I'd have to scooch the table with the minor over up against the other one. I don't buy it when people tell you that closets are the only way a ghost or monster can get into your room. Shucks, I bet you they got ways to come up from under your bed, or if they want to get at you real bad, I bet they can even slide out of a drawer that you think is shut good and right. Miss Thomas said, ""I’ll see you in the morning, you get a good night's sleep."" She closed the door and was gone just like that. Before you could say Jack Robinson I had the chair jammed up underneath the one doorknob and was trying to figure out the best way to push the dresser thing when I heard some loud voices coming from out in the hall. It was Herman E. Calloway and Miss Thomas going at each other pretty good. They argued back and forth so I sat on the bed and put my suitcase in my lap hoping that Mr. Calloway would win the argument and they'd give me some other place to sleep. I can never get why grown folks will put a kid all alone in a bedroom at night. It's just like they give the ghosts a treasure map and instead of there being a big pot of gold where X marks the spot, there's some poor kid that's sound asleep. The door banged open and Herman E. Calloway stood them huffing and puffing like the big bad wolf, only with his belly it looked like he'd already eaten the three little pigs. I wasn't too worried because I could see the toes of Miss Thomas's shoes in the doorway. Herman E. Calloway looked at me sitting on the bed and rushed over to the first little closet door. With one mighty huff he swiped the ghost-blocking chair away and stuck a key in the lock. Then he stomped over to the other closet door and locked it too. He kind of whispered so Miss Thomas couldn't hear. ""You've got the rest of them fooled, but not me. There's something about you that I don't like. I'm going to find out what your game is and you believe me, scamp, you're going back where you belong."" He stuck the key back in his pants pocket, walked out of the room and slammed the door. The door wasn't even done shaking from being slammed so hard when it jumped open again. Herman E. Calloway pointed a finger at me and said, ""And you better not do any snooping around this room or anywhere else in this house, I know where every single thing belongs and I can tell right away when something's missing. I've got little secret bells all over everything and when something's stolen the bell goes off and only I can hear it, so watch your step."" The poor door got slammed again. Miss Thomas said, ""You know, Herman, half the time I don't know if I should laugh at you or just feel sorry for you."" What Herman E. Calloway said reminded me of what they used to tell us when they'd take us kids from the Home to the YMCA to go swimming. Before we'd start swimming the white lifeguard made us sit on the edge of the pool with just our feet in the water. He'd say, ""We've had problems with you children urinating in the pool in the past, we've begged you and pleaded with you to stop but you don't seem to get the message. This has forced the Y to spend a great deal of money to put a special new kind of magic chemical in the water. ""This chemical reacts to turn water contaminated with urine a bright red. Therefore, if you urinate in the pool a bright red cloud will surround you and we will be able to tell who has relieved themselves. The chemical also causes severe burns to the skin of the urinater. ""So if a red cloud appears around any of you people you will be arrested by the Flint police, you will go to the hospital to fix your burns, you will go to jail and then your name will go on the list that says you can't swim in any pool in any building anywhere in the world. ""If a red cloud appears around any of you people you will from that moment on be swimming nowhere but in the Flint River."" Shucks, nothing makes you want to pee in a pool more than someone who thinks you're stupid telling you not to do it, and nothing makes you want to steal something more than having somebody who doesn't even know you're honest telling you not to steal. Herman E. Calloway didn't have to worry, I was a liar, not a thief. The only thing I'd ever stole was food out of someone's garbage can. He was so doggone mean and hard to get along with it just didn't seem like it was true that he could be anyone's daddy. The way he was so worried about me stealing stuff from him before he even knew if I was honest or not made me wonder if someone who was so suspicious could ever be kin to me. I looked around the little dead girl's room and could see that even a hard-up thief wouldn't find nothing much worth stealing in here. The best thing in the whole room was one wall that was covered with pictures of some horses cut out of a bunch of magazines and stuck on the wall with thumb-tacks. It looked like someone went through a lot of trouble to do it, each picture was held up with four thumbtacks and there were so many of them that they were like wallpaper from the floor to the ceiling. There might've been something good in the closets, but even before Herman E. Calloway'd locked them shut I sure wasn't about to peek in them. I set my suitcase on the dressing table and looked at the first drawer. Like I said, someone telling you not to do something will sure make you want to do it. I listened real careful to make sure Herman E. Calloway wasn't sneaking up on me, then I pulled the drawer open. There were three boxes of thumbtacks, and one of those doggone Ticonderoga pencils. Looking at it made me smell rubber all over again. I walked over to the bed and sat on the edge and flopped back into the mattress. Man! It was the softest thing I'd ever felt in my life, I rubbed my arms up and down on the blanket and pulled the pillow out and put it underneath my head. The bed had two sheets on it, just like Teddy boy's! It was strange, even though this was the bedroom of some little girl who'd kicked the bucket, I wasn't feeling scared or nervous at all. I took in a deep, deep breath and it felt like I was sleeping with my own blanket wrapped around my head. I took in a couple more deep breaths and I could hear Momma starting to read another story to me. I wanted to climb under the covers to see what it felt like to sleep with two sheets, but before I could even move -- woop, zoop, sloop -- I was sleeping like a dead man. The last thing I remember hearing was, ""Not me,"" said the horse. ""Not me” said the sheep. ""Not me,"" said the werewolf. I knew I was going to have a great sleep 'cause even though a monster had gone and snucked hisself into the story, I didn't care, nothing could hurt me now. I HAD TO FIGHT like a tiger to wake up the next morning. The first thing I saw was those horses thumb tacked all over the wall. I stretched and noticed my shirt was off. I kicked my legs and could tell I was under the covers with one sheet underneath me and one sheet on top of me and my pants were off too. Boy, I must've really been tired last night. I couldn't even remember getting undressed and getting between the sheets. But that explained why I was sleeping so hard, I found out one of rich people's secrets: Sleeping with two sheets puts you out like a baby that's been rode around in a automobile. I looked over and thought I was dreaming. My clothes were all folded up in a neat pile the same way Momma used to fold them when she'd go to work before I got up. I blinked my eyes a couple of times 'cause it looked like there was a note on my clothes. Momma would always leave me a note that said something like, ""Dear Bud, Please be neater, see you tonight, I love you."" My eyes started getting all stingy but I blinked them a bunch more times and the note disappeared. I kept blinking but the pile of clothes stayed right where it was. Aw, shucks, Miss Thomas must've come in at night and undressed me and put me in bed. I bet she got a real good look at my legs. I got up as quiet as I could and put my clothes back on. I could hear laughing and talking coming from downstairs. Right when I got near the kitchen door I could hear Herman E. Calloway saying, ""... so that's how that cookie's going to crumble."" Miss Thomas said, ""You have no idea how bad those orphanages can be, it's no place to be raised. I can't believe you, you'll take care of any stray dog wandering through this neighborhood, but when it comes to a child all of a sudden you have no sympathy. You might not have been paying attention, but we agreed last night what we were going to do about that boy and that's what we're sticking to."" Uh-oh. I was glad I didn't take anything out of my suitcase, 'cause it looked like I might be making a break for the street again. Herman E. Calloway said, ""Like I said, I'ma find out what the real story is in Flint, and then we'll see."" Miss Thomas said, ""That's fine, I believe the child. You, above all people, should know that I've got a sense about when someone is lying.""' Uh-oh, I'd have to remember that. She kept talking. ""Until we've heard otherwise from Flint, he's staying right here."" A fourth voice said, ""Well, I'm glad to hear it, that means I didn't go digging around in the basement for nothing. I think he's going to really like this."" It was Steady Eddie and it sounded like he had something for me! I ran back up the steps on my tiptoes and down the hall to the little dead girl's room. I stood outside the room and closed the door loud enough that they could hear it downstairs. I clump-clump-clumped down the hall to the door that Miss Thomas said was the bathroom. When I was done I pulled on a chain that made the water come down. The loud noise made me jump back. Man, these insidethe-house outhouses were hard to get used to. I washed my hands with running hot water and closed the bathroom door kind of loud. I clump-clump-clumped down the steps, stopping a couple of times to yawn real loud. When I walked into the kitchen they all had looks on their faces like they hadn't been talking about me at all. I said,""good morning, Mr. Calloway” but I didn't really mean it, then said ""Good morning, Miss Thomas, good morning, Mr. Jimmy, good morning, Steady Eddie."" I noticed right away that Miss Thomas didn't have all her diamond rings on, I guess it would've been hard sleeping with them flashing lights up at you, she must have to keep them closed up in a box that the sparkles can't get out of. I noticed too that even without the rings Miss Thomas still had to be the most beautiful woman in the world. They smiled and said, ""Good morning, Bud."" All except Herman E. Calloway. He got up from the table and said ""I don't like the way Loudean is sounding, I'ma have a look at her plugs."" We went outside through a door at the back of the kitchen. Miss Thomas said, ""Bud, we'd just about given up on you. Do you usually sleep until after noon?"" After noon? Man. I couldn't believe it, I'd slept as long as those rich folks in the moving pictures! ""No, ma'am, that's the first time I ever did that."" She said. ""I know you must be starving, but if you can hold out for another half hour or so Mr. Jimmy's going to make everyone's lunch. Think you can wait?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" A half hour wasn't nothing to wait, no matter how hungry you were. Mr. Jimmy said, ""So what's the scoop, little man?"" I didn't know what that meant so I said, ""Nothing, sir."" Steady Eddie said, ""How'd you sleep, kiddo?"" ""Great, sir."" Oops, I forgot I wasn't supposed to call the band men sir. He said, ""Cop a squat."" He pointed at a chair. I guessed that meant ""sit down,"" so I did. Miss Thomas said, ""Were your ears burning last night, Bud?"" Man, all these Grand Rapids people really do talk funny. I only came from the other side of the state and it was like they talked some strange language out here. I said, ""What, ma'am?"" She said, ""There's an old saying that when people talk about you behind your back your ears start to get real warm, kind of like they were burning."" I said, ""No, ma'am, my ears felt just fine."" She said, ""Well, they should've been burning, you were the subject of a very long conversation last night. But as sound asleep as you were, I'm really not all that surprised you didn't notice. I had to check your pulse to make sure you were still alive!"" Shucks! I knew it. She did come in when I was conked out and took my doggone pants and shirt off and put me there. Man, this was real embarrassing. Miss Thomas said, ""Mr. Calloway and the band and I talked about you for a long time. We've come up with something we want to discuss with you, but we need your help in deciding what to do."" Uh-oh. That was Rules and Things Number 36, or something, that meant I was going to have to get ready to go fetch something for her. I said, ""Yes, ma'am?"" She said, ""We've got to talk to some people in Flint first, but if they say it's all right, we were hoping that you'd stay here at Grand Calloway Station for a while."" A gigantic smile split my face in half. Miss Thomas said, ""I'm going to assume that that smile means yes."" I said, ""Yes, ma'am! Thank you, ma'am!"" Miss Thomas said, ""Before that grin gets stuck on your face, let me tell you you're going to have lots of chores and things to take care of around here, Bud, you'll be expected to pull your own weight the best you can. We all like a very clean house and none of us are too used to having children around, so we're all going to have to learn to be patient with each other. There's one person in particular that you're going to have to be very patient with. Do you know who I mean?"" I sure did. ""Yes, ma'am, it's Mr. Calloway."" She said, ""Good boy, give him some time. He really needs help with a lot of different things, he swears someone's adding weight onto that bass fiddle of his every year, but he's just getting older. He can use some young, why hands to help him around. Think you can handle that?"" Now I knew for sure she'd looked at my legs, she must've thought I was a real weakling. I said, ""Yes, ma'am, my legs are a lot stronger than they look, most folks are surprised by that."" Miss Thomas said, ""I don't doubt that at all, Bud. I'm not worried about your body being strong, I'm more concerned about your spirit. Lord knows Mr. Calloway is going to give it a test."" I said, ""Yes, ma'am, my spirit's a lot stronger than it looks too, most folks are really surprised by that."" She smiled and said, ""Very good, but you know what, Bud?"" ""What? ma'am?"" ""I knew you were an old toughie the minute I saw you""· I smiled again. She said, ""Our schedule's pretty heavy for the next couple of months, and then come September we'll have to see about school for you, but we'll be doing a lot of traveling right around Michigan, so I hope you don't mind long car trips."" ""No, ma' am."" She said, ""That's great, Bud. Something tells me you were a godsend to us, you keep that in mind all of the time, OK?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" Then she did something that made me feel strange. She stood up, grabbed both my arms and looked right hard in my face, just like Momma used to, she said, ""Really, Bud, I want you to always keep that in mind, this might get hard for you some of the time and I don't always travel with the band, so I don't want you to forget what I'm telling you."" I said, ""No, ma'am, I won't"" Steady Eddie said, ""Since you're going to be part of of family there're some things we've got to talk about. Now I've noticed the tight grip you keep on that old suitcase of your'n. I need to know how attached to it you are."" ""I carry it with me everywhere I go 'cause all my things are in there."" I wasn't sure if I liked the way this talk was going. Steady Eddie said, ""That's what I need to know, are you attached to the suitcase, or is it the things inside that are important?"" I'd never thought about that before, I'd always thought of the suitcase and the things inside together. I said, ""The things I got from my mother are the most important."" He said, ""Good, 'cause if you're going to be traveling with us it just wouldn't look too copacetic for you to be carrying that ratty old bag."" He reached under the kitchen table and pulled out one of those funny-looking suitcases that the band kept all their instruments in. This one looked like a baby one to his. He put it on the table, opened it and said, ""Since you're going to be traveling with Herman E. Calloway and the Worthy Swarthys, which is known far and wide as a very classy band, it's only fitting that you quit carrying your things in that cardboard suitcase. ""This is my old alto saxophone case, I've been hanging on to it for three years now, ever since the horn got stole right off the stage in Saginaw, but it doesn't look like I'm ever gonna get it back, so I figured you might as well keep your momma's things in it."" Wow! ""Thank you, Steady Eddie!"" I pulled my new case over to me. The inside of it had a great big dent where Steady Eddie's saxophone used to go, now there wasn't anything in it but a little raggedy pink towel. The case had some soft smooth black stuff all over the inside of it, it covered everything, even the dent. There was a real old smell that came out of it too like dried-up slobber and something dead. It smelled great! The back kitchen door opened and I thought Herman E. Calloway was coming back in to ruin everybody's fun, but it was the rest of the band. Everybody said hello, poured themselves some coffee, then sat down at the table. Doo-Doo Bug said, ""I see Mr. C.'s got Loudean's carburetor tore down again, anything wrong?"" Miss Thomas said, ""There's lots wrong, but not with that car."" They all laughed so I joined in too. I patted my new case and said, ""This here's my case now, I'm going to be going around with you."" They smiled and Dirty Deed said, ""So we hear. Glad to have you on board, partner."" Steady Eddie said, ""I was just about to tell him some of the things Herman E. Calloway requires of anybody in his band."" The Thug said, ""Otherwise known as Herman E. Calloway's Rules to Guarantee You Have No Female Companionship, No Alcohol and No fun at All."" ""Rule number one, practice two hours a day."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""That's a good one."" Steady Eddie said, ""Set got you this, Bud."" Steady Eddie had another present for me! This was a long, brown, skinny wooden flute. I was going to have to learn music! He said. ""It's called a recorder. Once you've developed a little wind, and some tone and a embouchure we'll move on to something a little more complicated."" These must've been more of those Grand Rapids words 'cause they sure weren't like any American talk I ever heard before. I said, ""Thank you!"" Steady Eddie said, ""Don't thank me until you've been through a couple of hours of blowing scales. We'll see if you're still grateful then."" The Thug said, ""Now all that's left is to give little stuff here a name."" Miss Thomas said, ""You know, I don't like the way Loudean's been sounding, I think I'm gonna go check the air in the trunk."" She picked her coffee up and started to leave the kitchen. Doo-Doo Bug said, ""You don't have to leave, Miss Thomas."" ""Darling, I know that, it's just that this is one of those man things that you all think is so mysterious and special that I have absolutely no interest in. The only thing I can hope is that the process has improved since you four were given your names."" Then she left the room. As soon as she was gone Steady Eddie told me, ""Hand me your ax and stand up, Bud."" I was starting to catch on to this Grand Rapids talk, I remembered that a ax was a instrument. I handed Steady my recorder and stood up in front of him. He said, ""Uh-uh, she was right, this is mysterious and special, so that grin's got to go, brother."" I tried to tie down my smile. Steady said, ""Mr. Jimmy, you're the senior musician here, would you proceed?"" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Gentlemen, the Door's open for names for the newest member of the band, Bud-not- Buddy."" They started acting like they were in school. The Thug raised his hand and Mr. Jimmy pointed at him. Thug said, ""Mr. Chairman, in light of the boy's performance last night at the Sweet Pea, I nominate the name Waterworks Willie."" Shucks, I was hoping they'd forgot about that. Mr. Jimmy said, ""You're out of order, Douglas."" Steady raised his hand. ""Mr. Chairman, this boy's obviously going to be a musician, he slept until twelve-thirty today, so I propose that we call him Sleepy."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""The name Sleepy is before the board, any comments?"" Dirty Deed said, ""Too simple. I think we need some thing that lets folks know about how slim the boy is."" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""How about the Bone?"" Steady said, ""Not enough class, he needs something so people will know right off that the boy's got class."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""How do you say bone in French? French always makes things sound a lot classier."" The Thug said, ""That's easy, bone in French is la bone."" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""La bone, nah, it don't have a ring to it."" Steady Eddie said, ""I got it, we'll compromise. How about Sleepy LaBone?"" I couldn't tie the smile down anymore, that was about the best name I'd ever heard in my life! Mr. Jimmy said, ""Let me try it out. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming out on this cold November night, this night that will live in history, this night that for the first time on any stage anywhere, you have listened to the smooth saxophonical musings of that prodigy of the reed, Mr. Sleepy LaBone !"" The whole crowd broke out clapping. The Thug said, ""What can I say but bang"" Dirty Deed said, ""You nailed him!"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""That is definitely smooth."" Steady said, ""My man!"" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Kneel down, young man."" I got down on one knee. Mr. Jimmy tapped me on the head three times with my recorder and said. ""Arise and welcome to the band, Mr. Sleepy LaBone."" I got off my knee and looked at my bandmates. Sleepy LaBone. Shucks, that was the kind of name that was enough to make you forget folks had ever called you Buddy, or even Clarence. That was the kind of name that was enough to make you practice four hours every day, just so you could live up to it! I HELD THE MOP SO that it was floating on the top of the water in the bucket. I was pretending it was that underwater boat in the book Momma read to me, Twenty Thousand Leaks Under the Sea. ""Captain Nemo” I whispered, pretending I was a sailor. ""Aye, matey?"" ""The squabs were only able to plug ten thousand of the leaks we have, that means we have ten thousand left, and dag-gum-it, I think we're going down with all hands on board!"" I looked up to make sure no one was watching me too close. The Dusky Devastators of the Depression were still putting their instruments on the stage, waiting for Miss Thomas and Mr. Jimmy and Herman E. Calloway. I whispered, ""Heavenly Father, all is lost!"" Then I made the mop sink into the water, drowning Captain Nemo, matey, and all the poor squabs. They went down with a bunch of bubbles and soap suds and dirt. I know Herman E. Calloway was trying to work me like a dog, but he was doing a real bad job at it. I'd already wiped all the tables and chairs down in the Log Cabin and now I was going back to clear-mop the floor for the second time. It was a piece of cake! The bucket even had a thing on top of it that you could use to wring the mop out, and Herman E. Calloway didn't even know how much fun I was having. Making somebody work hard isn't as easy as it looks, some folks are good at it and some folks aren't. Some folks can look at you and tell if you're even talking about slacking off, they'll add some work to you faster than you can say Jack Robinson. Some folks will find a excuse to strap you even if you're working as hard as you ever did in your life. I stuck the mop head into the wringer. I pretended it was somebody at a washing machine not paying attention to what he was doing and getting his whole body pulled through and wrungeded out. I let the handle up to see what was left of this poor soul but before I could check, someone yelled out, ""One, two, one two three!"" I looked up. The Thug was brushing his sticks across the round gold metal thing next to his drums and making it sound like a soft rain was commencing to fall on someone's tin roof. Only instead of sounding like rain splashing anytime it wanted to, the Thug had it sounding like it was coming down in a steady, bouncing way. Then Dirty Deed started making the piano sound like it was a kind of drum, for a second it fell right in with the rain pats that the Thug was making, then it took off and made you think of what Niagara Falls must sound like, it sounded like big, bright drops of water splashing up and over, over and up. The drops would fall loud and clear as anything, then before you knew it they were right back into the Thug's steady, bouncy beat. Steady Eddie started snapping his fingers real soft, in time with the piano and the drum, his toothpick jumping right along with his fingers. He put his ax in his mouth and blew, but instead of the horn making music it seemed like Steady made it talk. He blew one long, low, rumbly sound and I knew right then, with that one deep, sad moan, what the most beautiful sound in the world was. Steady held the note for a long time, then made the sax drift away from the rest of the storm of music. It swirled and floated back and joined the rain sound that the Thug and Dirty Deed kept going. I just stood there. I didn't even hear Miss Thomas and Mr. Jimmy and Herman E. Calloway come up from behind me. Miss Thomas rubbed her hand across my head and said, ""Bud, you've done a great job, the place is sparkling."" I was going to say, ""Thank you, ma'am"" but it seemed like talking was wrong what with all these wonderful sounds were coming from the people on the stage. Mr. Jimmy said, ""LaBone, looking good, son."" Herman E. Calloway grunted and the three of them walked up on the stage. Mr. Jimmy picked up his horn and joined in the storm. Miss Thomas sat on a stool, closed her eyes and (tucked her head up and down, up and down. Herman E. Calloway stood next to his giant fiddle and started bobbing his head too. He put one of his hands near the top of the fiddle and began pulling at the strings with his other hand. Every time he patted the strings it seemed like something wide and heavy was walking by slow and easy. Or it seemed like he was the thunder, soft and far away but getting closer all the time. All of the instruments blended up together and, just like that smell in the library, you couldn't tell which one was your favorite. First you'd say it was Mr. Jimmy on the trumpet, then Do-Doo Bug's trombone would make you think it was the best, then Dirty Deed would make the piano sound like water hitting big rocks and you'd know there wasn't anything that sounded that good until Steady Eddie would make the saxophone sing and talk and dance around everyone else and you'd swear that was the only sound you'd ever want to hear again. All the while Herman E. Calloway and the Thug kept everything moving by making the drums and the giant fiddle pound out a soft steady beat, like someone's heart turned way up loud. You'd have a real hard time trying to figure out which instrument was your favorite. Until Miss Thomas opened her mouth. While the rest of the band was being a storm, she was the sun busting through thick, gray clouds. With the first thing she sang, you had to wonder why this band was called Herman E. Calloway and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression, or Herman E. Calloway and the Nubian Knights, it should be called Miss Thomas and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression and a Mean Old Guy on the Giant Fiddle. She was so good she didn't even have to sing real words, mostly she was saying things like ""La da de da de da da, ha whee a ho, ha whee a ho, ha whee a day,"" then Steady Eddie would answer on the saxophone and before you knew it, the two of them were having a regular conversation. Every once in a while Mr. Jimmy's trumpet would come in and put his two cents' worth in, then it would fade away. All the other instruments took turns trying to interrupt the conversation, but in the end it was Miss Thomas's voice and Steady's saxophone doing the talking that you really wanted to listen to. Finally Miss Thomas did a bunch more ""Doe de doe de doe de bahs"" and Steady answered, then, just when you thought you could understand this language they were talking, Miss Thomas broke out in American, she sang, ""We haven't met since then, gee, but it's nice to see you again,"" she said, ""nice to see you, to see you again,"" and the storm was over. The last thing you could hear was the rain from the Thug and the thunder from Herman E. Calloway getting farther and farther away, like the storm had gone and blowed itself over into the next county. Then it was dead quiet. I let the mop fall over and clapped as loud as I could and said, ""Wow!"" Miss Thomas stood up and did one of those curtsey bows. I clapped louder. I could see now why this band got to have six exclamation points behind their name! WE GOT IN TWO CARS to drive for a hour and a half north of Grand Rapids. We were headed to a dinky town called Mecosta. I got to ride with the band while Mr. Jimmy and Herman E. Calloway and the instruments were riding in the Packard. Miss Thomas stayed back at Grand Calloway Station. I'd been living with Miss Thomas and the band for about seven days and this was already my third trip on the road. The band was doing their next favorite thing to playing music, they were teasing each other and talking about Herman E. Calloway behind his back. The Thug said to Dirty Deed, ""I'd be offended, man, and I ain't trying to say that you ain't good on the eighty-eights, but you know the only reason you got this gig is 'cause you're Dutch, you're white and you don't have the strongest personality in the world."" Deed said, ""Yeah, well, such is life. You think I'm going to give up the best gig in the state just 'cause you'd be offended? Take a look out the window, baby, there's a depression going on. How many folks you see living like us, Negro or white? Not many. That man may have his faults but he's a struggler, I'm putting my hat in with him. Eddie looked at me and said, ""Bud, Mr. C. has always got a white fella in the band, for practical reasons. But we don't hold his skin color against him, he can't help that he was born that way."" Deed said, ""You're just too kind, Edward."" Eddie kept talking, ""We do that 'cause the boy can play, Mr. C. won't compromise on his music."" I said, ""Why does he always keep one white guy in the band?"" Deed said, ""It's the way of the world, Sleepy. It's against the law for a Negro to own any property out wham the Log Cabin is so Mr. C. put it in my name."" Eddie said, ""That, and a lot of times we get gigs playing polkas and waltzes and a lot of these white folks wouldn't hire us if they knew we were a Negro band so Deed goes out and sets up everything."" ""But what do they say when the Dusky Devastators show up?"" Deed said, ""Well, it's too late for them to say anything then, it's us or no music."" Eddie said, ""And Mr. C. tells them if we aren't the best band they'd ever had then they don't have to pay. We haven't been stiffed yet."" With all the arguing and jokes about Mr. C., the trip seemed real short. We unloaded all of the instruments and waited for nighttime to come. I'd heard the band play and practice a thousand times and still had to just about sit on my hands when they were finished so I wouldn't bust out clapping. We finished our set at a little place called the Laughing Jackass and I got to sleep right onstage to guard the instruments. The next morning I was packing everything into the cases when I got some real bad news. Herman E. Calloway told Mr. Jimmy, ""I'ma stay and catch up with Eugene, you head back with the boys. The man who owned the club. Mr. Eugene Miller. used to be in one of Mr. C.'s bands. Mr. Jimmy said. ""Bud, take your time loading everything into the Packard and you call ride back with Herman."" Uh-oh. Me and Mr. C. looked at each other like this wasn't a good idea. He said, ""Whatever,"" and walked back to the club's office. Shucks, a whole hour and a half trapped in a car with him. I loaded all of the instruments into the Packard, sat on a big rock and took out my recorder to practice. I could hear Mr. C. and Mr. Miller talking and laughing for the longest time. At last Herman E. Calloway came out and walked over to the side of the building and started nudging things around with the toe of his shoe. I walked over to watch what he was doing. When I got next to him I could see that it was just rocks he was pushing around. Finally he grunted a couple of times and started to bend over but his big belly got in the way and wouldn't let his arms reach to the ground. After a bunch more grunts he said, ""Make yourself useful, boy, and hand me this one."" ""This what, sir?"" ""This stone, this one."" Right at the end of Mr. C.'s shiny brown shoe was a little roundish rock. I bent over to pick it up, blew some dirt off of it and turned it over a couple of times in my hand to try and see why Mr. C. thought it was so special. The only thing that I could tell was that he'd picked 3 perfect throwing rock, the exact same kind of rock I'd use if I was about to chunk someone in the head. I dropped it into his hand. He didn't look at it or nothing, he just stuck it in his pocket and I heard it bang up against some silver dollars. I kept my nose out of his business for as long as I could then had to say, ""Mr. C., wasn't that just a rock?"" ""Sure was."" He started walking back to the Packard. I followed. There were a million ways to ask what I wanted to know and I chose the worst one when I said, ""What in Sam Hill are you going to do with a doggone rock?"" It sounded a lot meaner than I wanted it to but I was really surprised that Mr. C. would want a old rock. He climbed in on one side of the Packard and I climbed in on the other. After he stuck the key in the dashboard he said, ""Bad habit."" Then he leaned over toward me and opened the glove box of the car. There weren't any gloves or maps or papers in the box, just a bunch of perfect throwing rocks. They all looked like they had writing on them. I reached in and took one of the rocks out. Written on the back of it was ""idlewild in 5.2.36."" I took another one and it said 'preston in. 6.4.36."" These were just like my rocks! I took one more and it said, ""chicago in 3.19.32."" I looked over to Mr. C. and said, ""I've got some of these, sir."" He said, ""Hmmm."" ""Really, I've got some too."" He looked at me, shifted his pipe away from the talking side of his mouth and said, ""Bud, I know you're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but those are found all over the world. In fact, they're about as common as rocks."" I almost didn't answer him but since I didn't want to look so stupid I said, ""Yes, sir, but mine have writing and numbers on them too."" He said, ""Hmmm."" We kept driving. Finally I said to him, ""You don't believe me, I’ll show you."" I dropped his three rocks back into the glove box and closed it, then climbed over the front seat to get at my sax case. I found it and set it on the backseat and un-locked it. As soon as I opened the top that smell of old spit and crumblingup velvet and mildew came rushing out, it was still great. I lifted the little door that covered my rocks and took two of them out. I climbed back over the front seat but kept the rocks covered in my hand--if he was going to see these he was going to have to ask first. I crossed my arms across my chest and waited. It's a good thing I've got lots of patience 'cause I waited a long, long time. When we finally got back to Grand Calloway Station Mr. Jimmy helped us unload the car. Finally I decided that Mr. C. had waited long enough. I stuck my rocks in his face and said, ""See, I told you I had some rocks like those, the only difference is mine say, 'flint in dot eight dot eleven dot eleven' and 'gary in dot six dot thirteen dot twelve. He said, ""Where did you find these? Didn't I tell you not to do any rummaging around in that room you been sleeping in?"" He reached for the rocks. I don't know why, but I let him take them. He was the first person other than Bugs that I'd ever let touch the rocks that my momma had give to me. Mr. C. turned the rocks over and over in his hands and said, ""Well? Where'd you get these?"" Uh-oh, I could tell by the way Herman E. Calloway was holding my rocks that he didn't plan on giving them back to me anytime soon. I kept watching his hand, waiting for a chance to snatch my rocks and get out of there. If I could get my hands back on my rocks I knew I could outrun Mr. C. even though he was a lot stronger and his legs were a lot longer than mine. Herman E. Calloway said, ""Answer me, where'd you take these from?"" Mr. C. sounded meaner than he ever had before. Mr. Jimmy heard him and put down the box he was carrying and walked over to us real quick. Herman E. Calloway had the rocks squeezed tight in his right-hand fist and had his left-hand fist balled up like he was ready to fight. Mr. Jimmy said, ""Herman? What's this? What's wrong?"" He stood between me and Mr. C. Herman E. Calloway said, ""I told you about this boy from the word go. He's been snooping through things in the house that he's got no business being in, he stole these."" I said, ""No, sir, I did not."" Mr. C. said, ""Then where'd you get them? I'm not going to ask you again."" He unsqueezed the rocks in his hand. I was surprised they hadn't turned into diamonds or dust the way he'd been holding them so tight. Mr. Jimmy took my two rocks from him. He looked at the writing and said, ""Flint, Michigan, August eighth, 1911, and Gary, Indiana, July thirteenth, 1912? That's more than twenty-five years ago."" He squatted down and looked right at me and said, ""Son, where'd you find these? Just tell the truth."" I kept one eye on Mr. C., he still looked like he was getting ready to jump funny on me. I said, ""Mr. Jimmy, I didn't find them or steal them from nowhere, these've always been mine. I got them from my momma and that's the swear-'fore-tied truth. Now could I please have my rocks back, sir?"" I stuck my hand out. Both Mr. Jimmy and Herman E. Calloway said, ""Your momma?"" ""Yes, sir."" I kept my hand out. Mr. Jimmy said, ""Bud, where did your mother get these?"" I said, ""I don't know, sir. She always had them."" Mr. Jimmy and Herman E. Calloway were looking at with that can't decidewhich-hand-to-smack-you- with-look when Mr. Jimmy said, ""Bud, what did you say your momma's name was?"" ""No one ever asked me, sir."" Herman E. Calloway was still hot. ""You throw a lot of 'sirs' around but you've still got a real strong, real small mouthed, disrespectful streak in you, boy. Now you answer the question or I’ll--"" I screamed at him, ""Angela, sir."" I was so mad that I hadn't meant to say ""sir"" but it came out anyway. ""Her name is Angela Janet Caldwell."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Lord have mercy... ."" Herman E. Calloway's pipe dropped out of his mouth and he stumbled and fumbled into Grand Calloway Station, feeling his way like he'd been struck blind. Then I knew! Herman E. Calloway was the best liar in the world, he'd been lying to me and everybody else all along! Now that there was some good proof against him he was all shook up. I said to Mr. Jimmy, ""I knew it! I knew he was my father!"" Mr. Jimmy was still crouched down right in front of me. He said, ""Bud, he's not your father."" ""Yes, sir, he is. That's why he run off like that, he got caught lying after all these years!"" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Bud, that's enough. Herman is not your father. But Angela Janet is his daughter's name. If what you're saying is true, Lord help us all, it looks like Herman might be your grandfather."" This was real surprising, but the thing I felt most was glad that Herman E. Calloway wasn't my dad. Shucks, who'd want a daddy that on top of being so old and so doggone mean had such a big belly? Not me. MAN! Ever since he heard me call my momma's name Herman E. Calloway had locked hisself up in his room and wouldn't come out. Mr. Jimmy and Miss Thomas made me sit at the kitchen table whilst they knocked on his door and tried to talk him into opening it up, but the way they kept saying ""Herman"" soft at first, then louder and louder, it sounded like he wasn't talking back. After the longest while they decided to let the big baby have his own way and came back downstairs. They sat at the kitchen table with me. Miss Thomas looked at me and said, ""My, my, my."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Now look here, Bud."" He wiped his hand over his face. ""You're sure your momma's name was Angela Janet?"" I said, ""Yes, sir."" ""And the two of you both had the same last name, her last name was Caldwell too, she never said nothing about being no Calloway?"" I spelt it out for him. ""No, sir, her name was Caldwell, C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L,"" It seemed like he finally believed me, he said, ""OK, "" I hope you don't mind me asking, Bud, but it's pretty important that we know, how'd your momma pass? And how long ago was it?"" Pass was just like gone, it was another one of those words grown folks use instead of dead. I said, ""I was six years old when it happened, sir. I don't know why, she was too sick to go to work for six days in a row, then one morning I went into her room and she was dead. But she didn't suffer or nothing, it happened real quick, she didn't even have time to close her eyes, she didn't look like it hurt or nothing."" Miss Thomas reached across the table and touched my arm, she said, ""I'm sure it didn't, Bud, I'm sure it was very peaceful for her."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""When she was living, Bud, God rest her soul, what'd your momma look like?"" This was another strange question, but before I could answer, Miss Thomas said, ""James, what are you insinuating? I knew there was something familiar about this boy, I don't know how I missed it before but look at Bud's eyes, you have to ask if this is Herman's grandchild?"" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Now hold on, Grace, I'm just trying to ask the questions I know Herman'd ask if he could. Ain't a thing wrong with being certain before we jump to any conclusions. Now what'd she look like, son?"" I said, ""She was real pretty, sir” Mr. Jimmy said, ""I bet she was, Bud, but that ain't what I meant. Was she short or tall, was she slim or big-boneded?"" I said, ""I don't know, sir, she was real pretty and real tall and kind of skinny like me, I guess."" Miss Thomas said, ""James, Bud was six years old, everyone on earth was real tall to him. I don't see the point in all this."" I said, ""Pardon me, ma'am, I know how I can show you what she looks like, I still got her picture."" They just stared at me. I said, ""Can I be excused?"" Miss Thomas said, ""Yes, son, hurry up and go get that picture."" I busted up the stairs but stopped like I hit a brick wall. I remembered how mad and crazy Herman E. Galloway looked when he yelled at me. I tippytoed up the rest of the steps. Uh-oh! Herman E. Calloway's door was opened up a crack! I held my breath and tiptoed extra quiet and extra fast right into the little dead girl's room and as soon as I did -- woop, zoop, sloop -- my heart jumped down into my stomach. Herman E. Calloway was sitting on the little chair in front of the little mirror on the dressing table. His elbows were on the table and his face was covered by his hands. It sounded like he was having trouble breathing 'cause every rime he sucked in a bunch of air he made a sound like ""Mu-u-u-u-h ..."" and every time he blew air out he made a sound like, ""H-u-u-u-h .. ."" I didn't know what to do. I could tell Mr. C. didn't know I was in the room with him so I could probably just backward tiptoe and get out of there without anything happening. I rose up on my toes, took two baby steps back and stopped. Shucks, I'd come up here to show Miss Thomas and Mr. Jimmy what my momma looked like, there wasn't nothing wrong with that, I wasn't doing nothing that meant I had to sneak out of this room on my tiptoes going backwards. I sucked in a mouthful of air and walked over to my bed. I picked up my sax case and set it on top of the bed. I pushed the two silver buttons to the side and the two silver tongues jumped open and made those loud click- click sounds. Herman E. Calloway still didn't take his face out of his hands. He kept going, ""Muh ... huh ... muh... huh.., muh... huh.. ."" I reached inside my sax case and took out the envelope with Momma's picture in it. I closed the two silver tongues again and could tell that Mr. C. wasn't paying me no mind at all, he kept his face in his hands, his head was rocking up and down real slow, sort of like he was checking to see how much it weighed. I put my sax case back next to the bed and was about to leave the room when I looked over at Herman E. Calloway's back. He still didn't know I was in the room with him. I looked in the little round mirror and still couldn't see his face, but I could see his hands a lot better. I could see six little trails of water coming out from where his fingers joined up with his hands, the three trails from each hand joined up together on his wrists and ran down his arms puddling up on top of the dressing table. Shucks, Herman E. Calloway was bawling his eyes out. He was acting like me being his grandson was the worst news anyone could ever give you in your life. This was Number 39 of Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things to Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of Yourself. RULES AND THINGS NUMBER 39 The Older You Get, the Worse Something Has to Be to Make You Cry With babies it's easy not to pay them no mind 'cause crying's just like talking for a baby. A baby's tears might mean, ""Hey! You just stuck a pin in my behind when you changed my diapers” or their crying might be the way they picked out to say, ""Good morning, Momma, what're we gonna do today?"" That makes it easy not to care too much about a baby's tears. When you got a old person crying you got a whole 'nother story. When you got someone as old as Herman E. Calloway crying you better look around, 'cause you know you're square in the middle of one of those boiling tragedies. You can't help but feel sorry for him, even if he's been mean to you from the minute he first had eyes on you, even if he's crying 'cause he found out the two of you were kin. I walked over to Herman E. Calloway and before I could think my hand moved out toward his back. I waited for one of those spaces between the muhs and the huhs, then I touched him. His skin under his shirt was very, very warm. It took a second for Herman E. Calloway to know someone was touching him. When he knew, I felt his skin jerk and twitch the same way a horse's does when a fly lands on it. He whipped his head around. When he saw it was me he jerked away, took one more giant huh, then stared. His mouth started moving like he was talking in a secret language that only dogs could hear. At last real American words started coming out of his mouth. He said, ""I ... I ... how'd... I'm, I'm so... look, Buddy... I... I just.. ."" ""It's Bud, sir, not Buddy."" He put his face back in his hands and broke down all over again. Man, it's a good thing the Thug wasn't around, 'cause if he'd've heard the way Mr. C. was weeping, no one would've wondered who the real Waterworks Willie was. I put my hand back on Mr. C.'s shoulder and patted him and rubbed him a couple of times, then left the room. It felt a lot better going out frontwards instead of sneaking out backwards. I ran down the steps back into the kitchen. Miss Thomas's and Mr. Jimmy's eyes jumped right onto my envelope. I set it in the middle of the table. Both of them just looked at it before Miss Thomas reached out and picked it up. She went into the pocket of her dress and took some funny little glasses that only had a bottom half to them, then put them on her nose. She pulled Momma's picture out and held it as far away from her eyes as her arms would stretch. She looked at the picture, looked over her glasses at me, then looked right at Mr. Jimmy and said, ""Any more questions for this young man?"" She slid the picture over to him. Mr. Jimmy picked it up and said, ""Well, I’ll be, remember that old con man who used to drag that ruint horse through town, now what was his name? Help me out here, Grace, didn't he call his act Joey Pegus and his Broke-Back Broncking Bucko?"" Miss Thomas said, ""It was Joey Pegus and his Broke- Back Bucking Bronco, James. What else do you see in the picture?"" Mr. Jimmy said, ""Uh, uh, uh, that definitely is Angela Janet Calloway!"" He looked at me and said, ""You sure this is your mother?"" I said, ""Yes, sir. But her name's Caldwell, not Colloway."" He said, ""Well, I'll just be."" Miss Thomas butted in on him. ""There's little doubt about that, James, but what we've got to do ..."" She kept on talking but I quit listening 'cause something just came out of the blue and give me a good whop right on my forehead. Without even thinking about what I was doing, I butted in on Miss Thomas and said, ""That means that's not some little dead girl's room I'm sleeping in, that's my momma's room!"" She looked at me kind of surprised, like this was the first time she'd had that thought too, she said, ""That's right, Bud, you're back in your momma's room."" I said, ""How come Herman E. Calloway never called on me and my mother? All he'd've had to do was call on us one time and I know she wouldn't have been so sad."" Miss Thomas and Mr. Jimmy took turns shooting quick looks at each other, then she said, ""Bud, give me your hand."" Uh-oh, pretty soon I'd have to come up with a Rules and Things about when Miss Thomas holds your hand. She stretched her arm across the table and I held on to her fingers. ""Bud” she said, ""Mr. C. excuse me, your granddad didn't know anything about you. No one knew where your mother had gone."" Mr. Jimmy said, ""That's right, son, she just up and run off one day. I mean we all knew Herman was hard on her, but it wasn't like it was nothing personal, he was hard on everybody. I used to tell him all the time to slack off some on the girl, to go easy, but I can remember his exact words. He said. 'Easy-go don't make the mare run. This is a hard world. Especially for a Negro woman. There’s a hundred million folks out there of every shades and hue, both male and female, who are just dying to be harder on her than I ever could be. She's got to be ready.' Shoot, I could see that the girl wasn't the type to--"" Miss Thomas said. ""James, why don't you go up and check on Herman."" She said ""why don't you,"" but it wasn't a question. Mr. Jimmy said, ""Oh. Oh, maybe I should” and left the kitchen. Miss Thomas told me, ""Bud, I know you can see your granddad has troubles getting along with most folks, right?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" ""I think it's because he expects so much out of everybody, himself included. And when you set your standards so high, you get let down a lot."" I shook my head up and down, acting like I understood. She said, ""Now take your mother, for instance. He was so, so proud of that young woman, and he loved her very, very much. He was determined that she was going to be the first Calloway to get schooling all the way through college so he thought he had to be strict on her, but he went overboard, Bud, simple as that. He used to crow about how his mother and father had been born slaves and how now it was only two generations later and the Calloways had come so far and worked so hard that one of them was actually going to be a teacher. ""It was his dream, not hers--not yet, anyway--and he never gave her time to pick it for herself. The more he pushed her, the more she fought him. Finally it got to be too much and she left. We think she ran off with one of Herman's drummers. ""We've been hoping for eleven years that she'd send word or come home, and she finally has. Looks to me like she sent us the best word we've had in years."" Miss Thomas smiled at me and I knew she was trying to say I was the word that my momma had sent to them. She said, ""Wait here for one second, precious. I've got to go to my room for something."" Miss Thomas was probably saying that as a excuse so she could blow her nose and cry, but she came back in a flash. She was holding a iron picture frame and handed it to me. ""This has been on my dressing table for thirteen years, Bud, ever since your mother was sixteen years old. Now it belongs to you."" I wanted to say thank you, but I just stared at the picture in the heavy iron frame. It was Momma. The picture only showed her head, all around the edges it was smoky or foggy so's that it looked like Momma'd poked her head out of a cloud. And Momma was smiling. The same soft smile she'd give me when she got home from work. It'd been so long since I'd seen Momma smile that I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Miss Thomas said, ""Let me show you something, Bud."" She took the frame out of my hands and said, ""Watch this."" She moved the picture up and down, right and left, then around in circles. ""Do you see how her eyes are on you all the time? No matter which way you look at the picture, she's watching."" It seemed like Momma was looking direct at me no matter where Miss Thomas put the picture. ""I can keep this?"" ""I feel like I've been holding on to it until the rightful owner came along, and it looks to me like he's finally shown up. What took you so long, child?"" Miss Thomas patted me underneath my chin. She said, ""But Bud, we've got a problem I'm going to need your help with."" Uh-oh. ""You said you were six years old when your mother died?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" ""OK, so that was four years ago."" ""Yes, ma'am."" ""You can remember how bad you felt when you first knew she was gone, can't you?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" 'Cause it still feels the same. ""Well, you've had four years to -- to heal that scar, but it still hurts some of the time, doesn't it?"" ""Sometimes a lot."" ""I know, Bud. But remember, your grandfather and I just found out that she passed. The hurt is brand-new for us” Miss Thomas started swallowing. ""And even though he hasn't seen her in eleven years, I know there isn't a day that goes by that he doesn't think about her. He'd never admit it, but there isn't one show that we give that he doesn't first look out into the audience, not to see how big the crowd is, but hoping that she'll be out there. Hoping that she'd've seen a flyer tacked to a telephone pole somewhere and would stop by to see him. He loved her so much, Bud. Sorry, sweetheart."" She took the hand she wasn't squeezing my fingers with and took out a handkerchief and blew her nose. ""Those stones that he picks up everywhere he performs are for her. She must've been four or five years old, the band was getting ready to travel to Chicago for a week and before we left he asked her what she wanted him to bring back for her. He was thinking a doll or a dress or something, but she told him, 'A wock, Daddy, bring me back a wock from Chicago.' So everywhere we went after that he'd have to get her a 'wock,' he'd write the city and the day we were there on them for her. He's got boxes of them upstairs, eleven years' worth. ""So, Bud, I don't know how Herman is going to be feeling after this, that's where I need your help. You've got to remember that both Herman and I love your mother just as much as you do."" This didn't seem like it could be true, not just because it didn't seem like anyone could love my mother as much as I do, but because it didn't seem like Herman E. Calloway could love anyone at all. Miss Thomas said, ""So if you can remember, Bud, be patient with him. That ornery old man upstairs is very, very hurt right now and I just can't say where he's going to land after this news gets through blowing him around."" Miss Thomas was starting to do that sting-y-eyed blinking. ""So we're going to have to give him some time, we're going to have to let him find out how he feels before…"" Mr. Jimmy came into the kitchen. 'Grace,"" he said, ""he wants you."" Herman E. Calloway was making everybody feel like they had the blues, it looked like Mr. Jimmy'd just wiped some tears from his eyes too. Miss Thomas came around to my side of the table and give me a hug. She said, ""You OK?"" I said, ""Yes, ma'am"" She said, ""Should I go see how he's doing?"" ""Yes, ma'am."" She left the kitchen and Mr. Jimmy went into the living room. I picked Momma's picture up and put it back in the envelope. Mr. C. chose a good name for his house 'cause not a second went by before the back door came open and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression walked in, talking like it was going out of style. As soon as they saw me they all got quiet. Doo-Doo Bug said, ""Hey, Sleepy LaBone, where's everyone at?"" I didn't want to embarrass anyone by saying that all the grown folks were sitting all over the house sobbing their eyes out, so I said, ""They're around."" I remembered not to call the band ""sir."" Steady said, ""Well, it's you we wanted anyway."" He put a old cardboard suitcase on the table and said, ""I told the fellas how hard you've been hitting that recorder and how proud I was of you, so we put a couple of nickels together""--he acted like he was yelling into the other room--""and Lord knows on the peanuts we get it was a real sacrifice."" He slapped some skin with Dirty Deed, then started talking regular again. ""Anyway, the Thug saw something at the pawnshop and we picked it up for you."" ""Can I open it?"" The Thug said, ""Well, if you don't, I don't know who will."" Eddie slid the cardboard suitcase over to in front of me. It looked worse than the one I used to carry around. One of the snaps on it was busted clean off and the other one was stuck. Steady Eddie said, ""it's what's inside that's interesting. Just pull on that snap real hard."" I pulled on the snap and it came off right in my hand. The Thug said, ""I knew it, the boy's just too country, he ain't used to handling fine merchandise. We should've given it to him in a paper bag."" I opened the suitcase. Whatever it was was wrapped up in crinkly, wrinkly newspapers. I started pulling newspapers off and could tell that their gift was real heavy. All of a sudden a shiny piece of gold showed through. I snatched more paper off and couldn't believe my eyes! The Dusky Devastators of the Depression had put their money together had had bought me a baby-size horn like Steady Eddie's saxophone! Steady Eddie could see I was stuck so he lifted out of the suitcase and fished around in the bag for its mouthpiece, the neck and the reed holder. He took the reed for a minute, put the horn together, than played it. Mur! My horn sounded great! Eddie said, ""It's an alto, Bud, there's a little rust in some of the seams, but that's to be expected with a horn that’s old. It's still got a good tone to it, this dent didn't do her off too much."" He showed me a big dent on the bottom part of my saxophone. ""I repadded, refelted and resprung it. The rest is up to you."" He reached in his pocket and took out a can that said BRASSO on the side. ""Get you a rag and shine her up. A man should polish his own horn."" I looked at my bandmates and said, ""Thank you, thank you very, very much. I’ll practice on this so much that I’ll be just as good as you guys are in about three weeks!"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""Ohhh, now that's cold."" I said, ""Really! I will."" The band laughed so I did too. Eddie said, ""Well, Mr. LaBone, I’ll tell you what, since you're so hot to get in this band, I'd better get you started on your lessons right away."" He pulled a big silver watch that was tied up to a long chain out of his pocket and said, ""I'm going by for a while now, but I’ll be back around seven. If you've got your ax polished up by then, I’ll bring some sheet music along and we can get started, sound good?"" His toothpick jumped with each word. ""Sounds great, Steady!"" Eddie took the strap off his neck and handed it to me. I put it on and Eddie handed me my saxophone for the very first time. It was the perfect weight! I said, ""Can I be excused?"" Dirty Deed said, ""What, you ain't gonna blow us some notes? We want to hear what you got, Mr. Three- Weeks-from-Now."" I said, ""I’ll let you hear me in three weeks when we're all on the stage together."" They laughed again and the Thug said, ""I'ma let you in on something, Sleepy LaBone, there's certain members of this band that you will be outplaying in three weeks, but it's gonna take you a whole lot longer to top me. On the real tip, it's gonna take you at least ten years before you'll be able to even hold my drumsticks."" Steady Eddie said, ""Yeah, and that's about nine years and ten months longer than you'l be with the band, Thug."" The Thug said, ""Awww, man, you ain't gonna start that up again, you gotta let me know what you heard."" I said, ""Can I be excused? "" Eddie said, "" 'head on, Sleepy LaBone, I’ll be back;"" I told my bandmates, ""Thank you again, thank you very much."" The Thug said, ""Nothing to it, little man."" Dirty Deed said, ""Now don't let that horn whip you, mm"" Doo-Doo Bug said, ""Our pleasure, Sleepy."" Steady Eddie said, ""Man, get outta here” I picked up both of Momma's pictures, my horn and the can of Brasso and ran up the stairs. When I got upstairs I saw that Herman E. Calloway's door was still open a crack. Miss Thomas's door was closed now and I could hear the two of them in her room talking real soft to each other. I could've stood outside the door and listened if I wanted to but that would've been rude, besides I didn't know for sure how long it would take me to polish up my new horn! I went into my mother's room and put my sax on the bed that Momma used to sleep in when she was a little girl. I put her smiling picture on the dressing table, then reached under her bed and pulled my sax case out again. I snapped the two silver snaps and started taking out all of my things. I took my old blanket out and remade my bed with it. I wasn't going to need to carry it around with me anymore. I opened the tobacco pouch and took out the rock that said Flint on it and set it on the bed. I took the pouch and the flyers and walked down the hall to Herman E. Calloway's room. Even though I could still hear him and Miss Thomas talking and boo-hooing in her room, I knocked on his door anyway. When no one answered I opened it. He had one of those dressing tables with a mirror stuck on the back of it too, so I walked real quick over to it and set the flyers and the bag of four rocks down. I got out of his room as fast as I could. Whew! Even though it was me who'd carried them around for all these years, you'd have to be a pretty big liar if you'd say those rocks and flyers really belonged to me. Herman E. Calloway's name was all over the flyers and his writing was all over the rocks. Besides, the way he'd looked so shook up when he saw those rocks for the first time I figure they meant more to him than they did to me anyway. I went back over to Momma's dressing table and opened the little drawer. I took one of the thumbtacks out and went back to Momma's bed. Next I took out the envelope that had her picture in it. I took out the picture of her riding the sad, saggy pony. I still couldn't see what she was so unhappy about, the Miss B. Gotten Moon Park looked like somewhere you could have a lot of fun. I poked the thumbtack into the top of Momma's picture and walked to the wall that she'd stuck all the pictures of horses on. I put Momma right amongst all those ponies and horses she liked so much. I didn't need to carry that doggone picture around, this wasn't how I remembered Momma anyway, Momma was always excited and jumpy, not sad and poky like this little girl. Momma was kind of old when I met her too, she wasn't young like this picture at all. The picture looked like it belonged. It's strange the way things turn out, here I'd been carrying Momma around for all this time and I'd finally put her somewhere where she wanted to be, back in her own bedroom back amongst all her horses. I went back to the bed and picked the Flint rock up. It was going to be enough. I didn't need those other things with me all of time. I didn't need them to remind me of Momma, I couldn't think about her any more if there were a hundred hours in every day and a thousand days in every week. I couldn't think of my momma any better than I already do. All I have to do is remember her hand on my forehead when she'd ask me something like, ""Baby, are you sick? Have you got a temperature?"" All I have to do is remember Momma letting me dry the dishes after she'd wash them, how she used to say no one in the world could dry a plate the way I could. All I have to do is take two or three deep breaths and think of all the books she'd read to me at night, and remember that no matter how long it took she'd read until I went to sleep. Deza Malone was right, I was carrying Momma inside me and there wasn't anyone or anything that could take away from that or add to it either. The one rock from Flint would be enough. I set it in my sax case. I picked up my saxophone. It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen! I wet the reed the same way I'd seen Steady Eddie do, then clamped it on the mouthpiece. I closed my eyes and counted to ten. If after I got to ten I blew the horn and it sounded pretty good I knew I'd be playing along with the Dusky Devastators of the Depression in a week or two. If I didn't sound so good it meant I'd have to practice for a couple of months before I'd be good enough to get onstage with them. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! I puffed my cheeks and blew as hard as I could. The saxophone only squeaked, squawked and groaned, then sounded like it was making up words like ahwronk and rooozahga and baloopa. Shucks, maybe I didn't puff my cheeks out right, maybe I was blowing too hard. I counted again. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! This time the horn only squeaked, squawked and groaned, it didn't sound like it was trying to make up any words. It sounded great! It wasn't perfect, like when Steady blew it, but I could tell that one day it was going to be. Something told me I could learn how to play this. Something told me that those sounds were more than just bad notes. If you didn't have a real good imagination you'd probably think those noises were the sounds of some kid blowing a horn for the first time, but I knew better than that. I could tell those were the squeaks and squawks of one door closing and another one opening. I looked at the picture of Momma that Miss Thomas gave me. Momma was looking right at me with that same soft smile. I know it's stupid to smile back at a picture but I couldn't help myself. I know it's even stupider to talk to a picture, especially when it hadn't said anything to start a conversation, but I had to say. ""Here we go again, Momma, only this time I can’t wait!"" I closed my eyes and began practicing. Shucks, as good as things were going for me now I'd bet you dollars to doughnuts that Steady Eddie was going to get here early. AFTERWORD ALTHOUGH BUD, NOT BLIDDY is fictional, many of the situations Bud encounters are based on events that occurred in the 1930s, during a time known as the Great Depression. And although the characters in BUD Not Buddy are fictional as well, some of them too are based on real people. One of the most enjoyable parts of writing is that an author can combine his or her imagination with the traits of real people to build new characters. That is what I did to create the characters of Lefty Lewis and Herman E. Calloway, both of whom are based loosely on my grandfathers. My mother's father, Earl ""Lefty"" Lewis, was one of six or seven redcaps who worked at the train station in Grand Rapids. Michigan, during much of the depression. The jobs of Pullman porter and redcap were among the few open to African American men at that time and carried a certain prestige in the black community. Nonetheless, they were extremely difficult jobs, often marked by eighty-hour workweeks, low salary and virtually no job security. These men could be fired for simply not looking happy enough. Grandpa Lewis did exceptionally well during the depression, supporting his family on the tips he received as a redcap. My mother remembers that my grandmother used to have to sew reinforced linings into the pockets of all Grandpa's pants because the weight of the pennies, nickels, dimes and occasional quarters that he was given as tips would eventually rip the seams out. She also remembers the leathery texture Grandpa's hands took on from carrying so much baggage at the station. As the depression deepened, the Grand Rapids train station cut back to two redcaps, and Grandpa was let go. He briefly opened a small restaurant and finally became the first African American cabdriver in Grand Rapids, a job he held until his retirement in 1972 at seventy-four years old. Earl ""Lefty"" Lewis also pitched for many years in the miners of the Negro Baseball Leagues. His fondest memory of that time was pitching twice against Satchel Paige. As he did with most opposing pitchers, Satch hung Grandpa with two losses. My father's father, Herman E. Curtis, was indeed a big bandleader for most of his adult life. He headed many different musical groups, my favorite being Herman E. Curtis and the Dusky Devastators of the Depression!!!!!! --a name that by itself deserves all six of those exclamation points! Grandpa attended the Indiana Conservatory of Music and was a classically trained violinist. He also played the bass fiddle, the accordion and the piano. Entertainment was an important part of life during the depression, for people wanted to forget their troubles by going to the movies, sitting around the radio, and listening and dancing to live music. Grandpa and his bands were well known throughout Michigan during this time. Being an orchestra leader was Grandpa Curtis's night time job. By day he wore many different hats, among them those of a chauffeur, boat captain, and truck painter. He owned several businesses in Grand Rapids and Wyoming, -Michigan, at a time when laws prohibited African Americans from renting or holding title to land in these two cities. Grandpa did this by having a white friend put his name on all records. The flexibility, people skills, hustle and willingness to work around unfair laws and situations that both of my grandfathers used allowed them to keep their families together during one of America's bleakest periods, a time that was especially hard on African Americans. Both of these men were fortunate and skilled enough to avoid the brunt of the Great Depression. The lives of Earl ""Lefty"" Lewis and Herman E. Curtis and the situations described in Bud Not Buddy are the exception, for the great majority of people suffered horribly during the period between 1929 and 1941. Parents often could not feed their children, so countless thousands of young people, some as young as eight years old, were abandoned or had to set out on their own in search of a meal and a warm place to sleep. These children survived the brutal life on the road by riding the rails, picking fruit, doing odd jobs, begging, stealing or whatever was necessary to get food. Much of what I discovered about the depression I learned through research in books, which is a shame--I didn't take advantage of the family history that surrounded me for many years. I'm afraid that when I was younger and my grandparents and parents would start to talk about their lives during the depression, my eyes would glaze over and I'd think, ""Oh, no, not those boring tall tales again!"" and I'd find the most convenient excuse I could to get away from them. Now I feel a real sorrow when I think of all the knowledge, wisdom and stories that have been forever lost with the deaths of my grandparents. Be smarter than I was: Go talk to Grandma and Grandpa, Mom and Dad and other relatives and friends. Discover and remember what they have to say about what they learned growing up. By keeping their stories alive you make them, and yourself, immortal. "
45,Where the Mountain Meets the Moon,"Lin, Grace",b052_WheretheMountain.txt,3,"Far away from here, following the Jade River, there was once a black mountain that cut into the sky like a jagged piece of rough metal. The villagers called it Fruitless Mountain because nothing grew on it and birds and animals did not rest there. Crowded in the corner of where Fruitless Mountain and the Jade River met was a village that was a shade of faded brown. This was because the land around the village was hard and poor. To coax rice out of the stubborn land, the fields had to be flooded with water. The villagers had to tramp in the mud, bending and stooping and planting day after day. Working in the mud so much made it spread everywhere and the hot sun dried it onto their clothes and hair and homes. Over time, everything in the village had become the dull color of dried mud. One of the houses in this village was so small that its wood boards, held together by the roof, made one think of a bunch of matches tied with a piece of twine. Inside, there was barely enough room for three people to sit around the table — which was lucky because only three people lived there. One of them was a young girl called Minli. Minli was not brown and dull like the rest of the village. She had glossy black hair with pink cheeks, shining eyes always eager for adventure, and a fast smile that flashed from her face. When people saw her lively and impulsive spirit, they thought her name, which meant quick thinking, suited her well. “Too well,” her mother sighed, as Minli had a habit of quick acting as well. Ma sighed a great deal, an impatient noise usually accompanied with a frown at their rough clothes, rundown house, or meager food. Minli could not remember a time when Ma did not sigh; it often made Minli wish she had been called a name that meant gold o r fortune instead. Because Minli and her parents, like the village and the land around them, were very poor. They were barely able to harvest enough rice to feed themselves, and the only money in the house was two old copper coins that sat in a blue rice bowl with a white rabbit painted on it. The coins and the bowl belonged to Minli; they had been given to her when she was a baby, and she had had them for as long as she could remember. What kept Minli from becoming dull and brown like the rest of the village were the stories her father told her every night at dinner. She glowed with such wonder and excitement that even Ma would smile, though she would shake her head at the same time. Ba seemed to drop his gray and work weariness — his black eyes sparkled like raindrops in the sun when he began a story. “Ba, tell me the story about Fruitless Mountain again,” Minli would say as her mother spooned their plain rice into bowls. “Tell me again why nothing grows on it.” “Ah,” Minli’s father said, “you’ve heard this so many times. You know.” “Tell me again, Ba,” Minli begged. “Please.” “Okay,” he said, and as he set down his chopsticks his smile twinkled in a way that Minli loved. THE STORY OF FRUITLESS MOUNTAIN Once when there were no rivers on the earth, the Jade Dragon was in charge of clouds. She decided when and where the clouds would rain upon the land and when they would stop. She was very proud of her power and of the reverence the people of earth paid her. Jade Dragon had four dragon children: Pearl, Yellow, Long, and Black. They were large and strong and good and kind. They helped Jade Dragon with her work and whenever they flew in the sky she was overwhelmed with love and pride. However, one day, as Jade Dragon ended the rain and moved the clouds away from the land, she overheard some villagers’ conversation. “Ah, thank goodness the rain is gone,” one man said. “Yes,” another said, “I’m so tired of the rain. I’m glad the clouds are gone and the sun is finally shining.” Those words filled Jade Dragon with anger. Tired of rain! Glad the clouds were gone! Jade Dragon was indignant. How dare the villagers dishonor her that way! Jade Dragon was so offended that she decided that she would never let it rain again. “The people can enjoy the sun forever,” Jade Dragon thought resentfully. Of course, that meant despair for the people on earth. As the sun beat overhead and the rain never came, drought and famine spread over the land. Animals and trees withered and died and the people begged for rain, but Jade Dragon ignored them. But their suffering did not go unnoticed by Jade Dragon’s children. They were horrified at the anguish and misery on earth. One by one, they went to their mother and pleaded forgiveness for the humans — but even their words did not soften their mother’s cold heart. “We will never make it rain for the people again,” Jade Dragon vowed. Pearl, Yellow, Long, and Black met in secret. “We must do something to help the people,” Black said, “If they do not get water soon, they will all die.” “Yes,” Yellow said, “but what can we do? We cannot make it rain. We cannot dishonor Mother with disobedience.” Long looked down at the earth. “I will sacrifice myself for the people of earth,” he said. “I will lie on the land and transform myself into water for them to drink.” The others looked at him in astonishment, but one by one they nodded. “I will do the same,” Yellow said. “As will we,” Pearl and Black said. So Jade Dragon’s children went down to earth and turned themselves into water, saving the people on the earth. They became the four great rivers of land, stopping the drought and death of all those on earth. But when Jade Dragon saw what her children had done, she cursed herself for her pride. No longer would her dragon children fly in the air with her or call her Mother. Her heart broke in grief and sadness; she fell from the sky and turned herself into the Jade River in hopes that she could somehow be reunited with her children. Fruitless Mountain is the broken heart of Jade Dragon. Nothing grows or lives on the mountain; the land around it is hard and the water of the river is dark because Jade Dragon’s sad spirit is still there. Until Jade Dragon is no longer lonely and reunited with at least one of her children, Fruitless Mountain will remain bare. “Why doesn’t someone bring the water of the four great rivers to the mountain?” Minli asked, even though she had asked this question many times before. Every time Ba told the story, she couldn’t help think how wonderful it would be to have the mountain blooming with fruit and flowers, bringing richness to their needy village. “Wouldn’t that make Jade Dragon happy?” “When Jade Dragon’s children turned themselves into water,” Minli’s father said, “they were at peace and their spirits were released. Their spirits are no longer in the water. So Jade Dragon cannot find them in the rivers. Over a hundred years ago, a man tried to reunite them by taking stones from the mountain to the rivers.” “That man was not taking the stone for a dragon spirit,” Minli’s mother cut in. She never quite approved of Ba’s stories as she felt they made Minli impractical and caused her to daydream. “My grandmother told me he was an artist. He took the mountain rock to carve into inking stones.” “Did he ever come back?” Minli asked. “No. It probably did not make good ink,” Ma sighed. “He probably found something finer elsewhere. I bet the bronze on his horse’s saddle was more than we will ever have.” Ma’s sighs made Minli wish that every rock of Fruitless Mountain was gold and she couldn’t help asking, “So how will Fruitless Mountain ever grow green again?” “Ah,” her father said, “that is a question you will have to ask the Old Man of the Moon.” “Oh, tell that story next!” Minli begged. “Whenever I ask something important, people say, ‘That is a question you have to ask the Old Man of the Moon.’ Someday, I will ask him.” “The Old Man of the Moon! Another story! Our house is bare and our rice hardly fills our bowls, but we have plenty of stories.” Ma sighed again. “What a poor fortune we have!” “Maybe,” Ba said to Minli, glancing at Ma, “I should tell you that story tomorrow.” CHAPTER 2 Every morning, before the sun rose, Minli, her mother, and father began work in the fields. It was planting season, which was especially grueling. The mud stuck to their feet like glue and each seedling had to be painstakingly planted by hand. When the hot sun burned overhead, Minli’s knees shook from weariness. She hated the feeling of thick, soggy mud on her hands and face; and many times she wanted to stop in irritation and exhaustion. But seeing her parents’ bent backs, patiently working, made her swallow her complaints and continue. As soon as the sun began to set, Minli’s parents sent her home to make dinner and to rest while they continued to work in the thick mud. They would not come home until the sun had completely disappeared from the sky. At home, Minli washed her face and hands and feet; and even though all the water in the basin turned brown, she still felt like she was covered in mud. Her arms and legs were so tired that she felt like an old crab crawling on rocks. As she looked at herself reflected in the dark water, she saw Ma’s frown on her face. Ma is right, Minli thought. What a poor fortune we have. Every day, Ba and Ma work and work and we still have nothing. I wish I could change our fortune. At that very moment, Minli heard a faint murmuring sound that she had never heard before, like a song chanted from the clouds. Curious, she opened the door to see what the noise was. And there, on the road in front of her house, she saw a small stranger calling out quietly. “Goldfish,” he was saying softly, as if he were coaxing his fish to swim. “Bring fortune into your home.” Minli and the villagers stared as he wheeled his cart. Even though the village was by a river, it had been many years since anyone had seen a glimpse of a goldfish. The fish in the Jade River were brown and gray, like the village. The goldfish man’s cart was full of bowls of flashing fish that glittered like jewels. His gentle calling drew Minli to him like a moth to a lit lantern. “How does a goldfish bring fortune into your home?” Minli asked. The goldfish man looked at her; the sun setting behind him made him glow bright red and yellow. “Don’t you know?” he asked her. “Goldfish means plenty of gold. Having a bowl of goldfish means your house will be full of gold and jade.” As Minli stared into his bowls with her shining black eyes, a brilliant orange fish stared back at her with its shining black eyes. And then quickly, so quickly that Minli barely thought about it, she turned into the house and grabbed the two copper coins from the white rabbit rice bowl. “I’ll buy that one,” Minli said, and she pointed at the fiery orange fish with the black eyes and fin that had caught her eye. The other village children looked at her enviously while the watching adults shook their heads. “Minli,” one neighbor said, “don’t believe his impossible talk. A goldfish won’t bring fortune. Save your money.” But Minli was not discouraged and she held out her copper coins to the goldfish man. He looked at her and smiled. Then he took one coin, picked up the fishbowl, and gave it to her. “May it bring you great fortune,” he said. And with a small bow to the villagers, he wheeled out of the village. In moments, he disappeared from view into the shadow of Fruitless Mountain, and if it wasn’t for the goldfish Minli had in her hands, all would have thought he was a dream. CHAPTER 3 But the goldfish was real, and when her parents returned from the fields for dinner they were not happy to learn that Minli had spent her money on it. “How could you spend your money on that!” Ma said, slapping the rice bowls on the table. “On something so useless? And we will have to feed it! There is barely enough rice for us as it is.” “I will share my rice with it,” Minli said quickly. “The goldfish man said that it will bring fortune to our house.” “Fortune!” Ma said. “You spent half the money in our house!” “Now, Wife,” Ba said, sitting quietly, “it was Minli’s money. It was hers to do with as she wished. Money must be used sometime. What use is money in a bowl?” “It is more useful than a goldfish in a bowl,” her mother said shortly. “Who knows,” Ba said. “Maybe it will bring fortune to our house.” “Another impossible dream,” Ma said, looking at the plain rice in her bowl with bitterness. “It will take more than a goldfish to bring fortune to our house.” “Like what?” Minli asked. “What do we need to bring fortune here?” “Ah,” Ba said, “that is a question you will have to ask the Old Man of the Moon.” “The Old Man of the Moon again,” Minli said, and she looked at her father. “Ba, you said you would tell me the Old Man of the Moon story again today.” “More stories!” Ma said, and her chopsticks struck the inside of her empty rice bowl resentfully. “Haven’t we had enough of those?” “Now, Wife,” Ba said again, “stories cost us nothing.” “And gain us nothing as well,” Ma said. There was a stony silence as Ba looked sadly into his rice bowl. Minli tugged at his sleeve. “Please, Ba?” she said. Ma shook her head and sighed, but said nothing, so Ba began. THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN OF THE MOON Once there was a magistrate who was quite powerful and proud. He was so proud that he demanded constant respect from his people. Whenever he made a trip out of the city, no matter what time of day or night, people were to leave their homes, get on their knees, and make deep bows as he passed, or else face the brutal punishment of his soldiers. The magistrate was fierce in his anger as well as his pride. It is said he even expected the monkeys to come down from the trees to bow to him. The magistrate was harsh with his subordinates, ruthless to his enemies, and pitiless to his people. All feared his wrath, and when he roared his orders the people trembled. Behind his back, they called him Magistrate Tiger. Magistrate Tiger’s most coveted wish was to be of royal blood. His every decision was crafted for that purpose; every manipulation was part of a strategy to achieve acceptance into the imperial family. As soon as his son was born, he began to make trips and inquiries to gain influence, in hopes that he could marry his son to a member of the imperial family. One night, as the magistrate traveled through the mountains (again on a trip to gain favor for his son’s future marriage), he saw an old man sitting alone in the moonlight. The old man ignored the passing horses and carriages, the silk brocade and the government seal, and simply continued reading a large book in his lap, placidly fingering a bag of red string beside him. The old man’s indifference infuriated Magistrate Tiger and he ordered the carriage to stop. However, even the halting noises did not make the old man look up. Finally, Magistrate Tiger exited his carriage and went to the old man, still engrossed in his book. “Do you not bow to your magistrate?!” he roared. The old man continued to read. “What are you reading that is so important?” the magistrate demanded, and looked at the pages of the book. It was full of scribbles and scrawls that were not of any language the magistrate knew of. “Why, it’s just nonsense written in there!” “Nonsense!” the old man said, finally looking up. “You fool. This is the Book of Fortune. It holds all the knowledge of the world — the past, present, and future.” The magistrate looked again at the marks on the page. “I cannot read it,” he said. “Of course not,” the man said. “But I, the Old Man of the Moon, Guardian of the Book of Fortune, can read it. And with it, I can answer any question in the world.” “You can answer any question in the world?” the magistrate scoffed. “Very well. Who will my son marry when he is of age?” The Old Man of the Moon flipped the pages of the book. “Hmm,” he said to himself. “Yes, here it is… your son’s future wife is now the two-year-old daughter of a grocer in the next village.” “The daughter of a grocer!” the magistrate spat. “Yes,” the Old Man of the Moon continued. “Right now she is wrapped in a blue blanket embroidered with white rabbits, sitting on the lap of her blind grandmother in front of her house.” “No!” the magistrate said. “I won’t allow it!” “It’s true,” the Old Man said. “They are destined to be husband and wife. I, myself, tied the red cord that binds them.” “What red cord?” Magistrate Tiger demanded. “Do you know nothing? I tie together everyone who meets with these red threads.” The Old Man sighed, holding up his bag full of red string. “When you were born, I tied your ankle to your wife’s ankle with a red thread, and as you both grew older the line became shorter until you eventually met. All the people you’ve met in your life have been brought to you by the red cords I tied. I must have forgotten to tie the end of one of the lines, which is why you are meeting me now. I won’t do that again.” “I don’t believe you,” the magistrate said. “Believe or don’t believe,” the Old Man said, standing up and putting the big book on his back, “we have reached the end of our thread and I will now leave.” The magistrate stared in dumbfounded silence as the Old Man of the Moon walked away up the mountain. “Crazy old man,” the magistrate said finally. “What a waste of my time!” The magistrate returned to his carriage and continued on. But as they drove through the next village, he saw an old blind woman holding a baby girl in front of a house. The girl was wrapped in a blue blanket embroidered with white rabbits, just as the Old Man of the Moon had said. Magistrate Tiger burned with anger. “I will not let my son marry a grocer’s daughter!” he vowed. So, after he arrived at his guesthouse, the magistrate secretly ordered one of his servants to return to the grocer’s home and stab the girl with a knife. That will take care of her, he thought to himself. Many years later, Magistrate Tiger had his dream fulfilled. He was finally able to obtain a match for his son with one of the emperor’s many granddaughters, and his son would inherit the rule of a remote city. On the wedding day, Magistrate Tiger bragged to his son about how he had arranged the marriage and outwitted the Man of the Moon. The son (who was not like his father) said nothing, but after the wedding ceremony, sent a trusted servant to find the grocer’s family to make amends. In the meantime, he became acquainted with his bride and was happy to find that both were pleased with each other. He found his new wife beautiful, the only oddity about her being that she always wore a delicate flower on her forehead. “Dear Wife,” he said, “Why do you always wear that flower? Even to sleep, you never remove it.” “It is to hide my scar,” she said, touching her forehead in embarrassment. “When I was a child no older than two, a strange man stabbed me with a knife. I survived, but I still have this scar.” And at that moment, the trusted servant came rushing in. “Master,” he said, “I made the inquiries you asked for. In a flood many years ago, the grocer’s family perished — except for the daughter. The king of the city (the emperor’s ninth son) then adopted the daughter and raised her as his own… and that daughter is your wife!” “So the Old Man of the Moon was right!” Minli said. “Of course he was,” Ba replied. “The Old Man of the Moon knows everything and can answer any question you ask.” “I should ask him how to bring fortune to our house!” Minli said. “He would know, I’ll ask him. Where do I find him?” “They say he lives on top of Never- Ending Mountain,” Ba said. “But no one I have ever spoken to knows where that is.” “Maybe we can find out,” Minli said. “Oh, Minli!” Ma said impatiently. “Bringing fortune to our house! Making Fruitless Mountain bloom! You’re always wishing to do impossible things! Stop believing stories and stop wasting your time.” “Stories are not a waste of time,” Ba said. “Stories,” Ma said, slapping her hands against the table, making the water in the fishbowl sway as she stood up and left the table, “are what wasted money on this goldfish.” Minli stared down at her rice bowl; the few white grains left sat like precious pearls at the bottom of her bowl. Ba patted her arm. “Eat all your rice, Daughter,” he said, and with his shaking hands, he scooped the last of his own rice to feed the fish. CHAPTER 4 That night Minli could not sleep. Ma’s words echoed in her ears and when she closed her eyes she saw Ba’s hand, shaking from hard work, feeding the goldfish. “Ma is right,” Minli thought to herself, “the goldfish is just another mouth to feed. I can’t let Ba feed the goldfish. Ma and Ba work so hard for every grain of rice, Ba shouldn’t have to feed the goldfish too.” Minli slipped quietly out of her bed and crept to the table where the goldfish was. They stared at each other and Minli knew what she had to do. Quickly, slipping on her shoes and jacket, she took the goldfish and left the house. It was late. The village was quietly asleep and the stars above filled the sky like spilled salt on dried seaweed. Minli’s footsteps seemed to hush the night as she made her way toward the Jade River. At the edge of the river, Minli looked at her goldfish one last time. The moon shone above so even in the darkness of the night, the fish seemed to burn a bright orange. Its black eyes sparkled at her. “I’m sorry I can’t keep you,” Minli whispered. “I hope you will be all right in the river.” And with those words, she emptied the bowl into the water. For a moment the fish seemed shocked and was still, like a flickering flame on a match. Then it wiggled in the water and swam in circles, a joyful fire twirling in the water. Minli watched it and sighed. As the sound faded into the night, Minli realized it was an echo of her mother’s impatient, frustrated noise. “Ma will never stop sighing unless our fortune changes. But how will it ever change?” Minli asked ruefully. “I guess that is just another question for the Old Man of the Moon. Too bad no one knows how to get to Never-Ending Mountain to ask him anything.” The fish stopped swimming and looked up at Minli. “I know where it is,” it said. The female voice was high and soft, like the wind whistling through the reeds of the water. Minli stared. “Did you say something?” she asked. “Yes,” the fish said. “I know how you can get to Never-Ending Mountain and ask the Old Man of the Moon a question.” “You’re a talking fish?” Minli asked, her words tumbling into each other with excitement. “How can you talk?” “Most fish talk,” the fish said, “if you are willing to listen. One, of course, must want to hear.” “I do,” Minli said, enthralled and eager. This was just like one of Ba’s stories! She bubbled with excitement. “How do you know the way to NeverEnding Mountain?” “I’ve swum all the oceans and rivers, except for one,” the fish said, “and on my way to the last, the goldfish man caught me. I despaired in his cart, for I have seen and learned much of the world, including the way to NeverEnding Mountain. Since you have set me free, I will tell you.” “You’ve swum all the oceans and rivers?” Minli asked. The questions spilled like overflowing water. “Which river haven’t you seen? Why have you traveled so much? Where is NeverEnding Mountain? When did…” “This river is the one river I have not swum,” the fish interrupted, “and I have waited a long time to see it. So I would like to start as soon as possible. You can ask the Old Man of the Moon all your other questions. Let me tell you the way to him so I can be off.” Minli nodded and asked no more. She realized she was having a conversation with a goldfish, which was very unusual, so she decided to listen. CHAPTER 5 The next morning, Minli felt as if her head was spinning with thoughts and plans. She was so busy thinking and plotting that she barely noticed her parents nodding sadly at each other when they saw the empty fishbowl. And in the fields, when Minli worked as if in a daze, her parents said nothing about her slow and messy planting. When the sun began to set and Minli went home to make dinner, she quickly washed and made the rice. Then she set the table for two people, sat down and wrote this note: Dear Ma and Ba, I am going to Never-Ending Mountain to ask the Old Man of the Moon how I can change our fortune. I might be away for many days, but don’t worry, I will be fine. When I come back, we will be able to fill our house with gold and jade. Love your obedient daughter, Minli The obedient part isn’t completely true, Minli thought to herself, as she knew her parents would not be happy to find her gone. But it’s not false either. They didn’t say I couldn’t go, so I’m not being disobedient. Still, Minli knew that wasn’t entirely right either. But she shook away her uneasy feelings and prepared for her journey. On a blanket, she put: a needle a pair of chopsticks her white rabbit rice bowl a small piece of dried bamboo a hollow gourd full of water a small knife a fishnet some uncooked rice a large pot and the one remaining copper coin Then she wrapped her blanket into a bag, tied it on her back, and took a last look at the shabby house. Through the window, Fruitless Mountain stood like a shadow, but Minli closed her eyes and imagined the house shimmering with gold and the mountain jade green with trees, and smiled. Then, she opened the door and left."
46,Discovering Mars: The Amazing Story of the Red Planet,"Berger, Melvin",b053_DiscoveringMarsTheAmaingStoryoftheRedPlanet.txt,3,"Mars is very cold and very dry. Scattered across the surface are many giant volcanoes. Lava covers much of the land. In Mars’ northern half, or hemisphere, is a huge raised area. It is about 2,500 miles wide. Astronomers call this the Great Tharsis Bulge. There are four mammoth volcanoes on the Great Tharsis Bulge. The largest one is Mount Olympus, or Olympus Mons. It is the biggest mountain on Mars. Some think it may be the largest mountain in the entire solar system. Mount Olympus is 15 miles high. At its peak is a 50 mile wide basin. Its base is 375 miles across. That’s nearly as big as the state of Texas! Mauna Loa, in Hawaii, is the largest volcano on earth. Yet, compared to Mount Olympus, Mauna Loa looks like a little hill. The Hawaiian volcano is only 5½ miles high. Its base, on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, is just 124 miles wide. Each of the three other volcanoes in the Great Tharsis Bulge are over 10 miles high. They are named Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons.
Using the space station as a jumping-off point will save a tremendous amount of fuel. Earth's gravity is strongest right at the surface. The high-er you go, the weaker the pull of gravity and the less fuel that is needed. When all is ready, the people on the space sta-tion will launch a cargo ship without astronauts. The cargo ship will carry fuel and supplies. It will also carry a smaller craft to land on Mars. The cargo ship will go into orbit around Mars. After it is in place, an eight-person crew will blast off from the space station in another spaceship. The crew will attach their ship to the cargo ship. Some of the crew members will remain in the cargo craft. They will be ready to help in an emer-gency. The other astronauts will climb into the landing craft and fly down to the surface of Mars. These astronauts will explore the Red Planet. Dressed in space suits, they will collect samples, run experiments, make observations, and learn how to survive on Mars. After about a month, the astronauts on Mars will use the landing craft again. This time it will lift them off the surface of Mars to join up with the cargo ship. Then they will all rocket back to the space station. From there they can take the short, easy flight home.

47,Hurricanes: Earth’s Mightiest Storms,"Lauber, Patricia",b055_HurricanesEarthsMightiestStorms.txt,3,"Great whirling storms roar out of the oceans in many parts of the world. They are called by several names—hurricane, typhoon, and cyclone are the three most familiar ones. But no matter what they are called, they are all the same sort of storm. They are born the same way, in tropical waters. They develop the same way, feeding on warm, moist air. And they do the same kind of damage, both ashore and at sea. Other storms may cover a bigger area or have higher winds, but none can match both the size and the fury of hurricanes. They are earth’s mightiest storms. Like all storms, they take place in the atmosphere, the envelope of air that surrounds the earth and presses on its surface. The pressure at any one place is always changing. There are days when air is sinking and the atmosphere presses harder on the surface. These are times of high pressure. There are days when a lot of air is rising and the atmosphere does not press down as hard. These are times of low pressure. Low-pressure areas over warm oceans give birth to hurricanes. No one knows exactly what happens to start these storms. But when conditions are right, warm, moist air is set in motion. It begins to rise rapidly from the surface of the ocean in a low-pressure area. Like water in a hose, air flows from where there is more pressure to where there is less pressure. And so air over the surface of the ocean flows into the low-pressure area, picking up moisture as it travels. This warm, moist air soars upward. As the air rises above the earth, it cools. The cooling causes moisture to condense into tiny droplets of water that form clouds. As the moisture condenses, it gives off heat. Heat is one kind of energy. It is the energy that powers the storm. The clouds are the source of the storm’s rain. The low-pressure area acts like a chimney— warm air is drawn in at the bottom, rises in a column, cools, and spreads out. As the air inside rises and more air is drawn in, the storm grows. The air being drawn in, however, does not travel in a straight line. The earth’s surface is rotating, and the rotation causes the path to curve. The air travels in a spiral within the storm. In the Northern Hemisphere, the spiraling winds travel counterclockwise—the opposite of the way the hands on a clock move. In the Southern Hemisphere, they travel clockwise. Most of these storms die out within hours or days of their birth. Only about one out of ten grows into a hurricane. Today rugged planes carry many instruments into hurricanes as they near land. The instruments measure winds, temperatures, and humidity. They measure the water content of clouds. They photograph the inside of hurricanes. They record radar images of the storms. In April 1960, the first weather satellite rocketed into orbit. Now scientists hoped to find and track tropical storms before they neared land. They were rewarded almost at once. A few days after its launching, the satellite discovered a typhoon in the South Pacific. Satellite instruments do not see into the heart of a hurricane—that work is still done by planes. Satellites show the size of the storm and its growth. They show changes in the size of the eye: if the eye is growing bigger, the storm is weakening; if it is growing smaller, the storm is strengthening. Most important, satellites can pinpoint the location of a storm, record its speed, and track it closely."
48,Toys!: Amazing Stories Behind Some Great Inventions,"Wulffson, Don",b057_ToysAmaingStories.txt,3,"Play-Doh began as a product for cleaning wallpaper. The seesaw was first used as a prop in the bloody spectacle in the arenas of ancient Rome. Long ago there were kites so large that people could be flown on them. Behind every toy there is a story. But some toys have far stranger stories than others. Only those toys that had the most surprising and unbelievable origins are found in this book. Even though we know generally where and when a given toy was made, the chapters of this book are not in chronological order because there are all sorts of ways in which toys and their histories overlap. For example, tops have been around much longer than today's action figures—but action figures are a type of doll, and dolls were invented thousands of years before tops. So, really, there is no way to put the history of toys into a simplified order. In 1976, a time capsule was buried in Washington, D.C. Inside the capsule are dozens of toys from the last century. In 2076, exactly one hundred years later, it will be opened. People then will marvel at the wonderful jumble of toys and see how we lived, how we dressed, and what we believed. Just as we are now, they will be amused and surprised by the toys they find, and from them, fry to better understand the past. It was a mistake. A goof-up. An invention that didn't work A flop; that's what the Slinky was, at least in the beginning. In 1945, an engineer by the name of Richard James was hard at work in a Philadelphia shipyard. The U.S. Navy had hired him to invent a stabilizing device for its ships. When a ship is plowing through the waves at sea, it pitches and plunges and rocks every which way. And its navigational instruments do, too. Richard's job was to come up with something that would counterbalance the instruments so that they would be level at all times. Springs. Richard believed that some sort of arrangement of springs would do the trick He tried all different types and sizes, and put them together in every conceivable way. For weeks he toiled, making dozens of different devices. But none of them worked. In fact, he never did come up with the item the Navy had hired him to invent. But one day Richard accidentally knocked a large experimental spring off a shelf. It should have just plopped to the floor. Instead, it walked down. Crawled, really. Coil by coil, end over end, it descended onto a stack of books ... then down to a desktop ... down to a chair ... and from there to the floor, where it gathered itself back together. He tried it again and again. Each time, the same thing happened. 
Some inventions popped up in different parts of the world at different times—but nobody knows for sure where and when they first originated. One of these is the seesaw. The Polynesians, Egyptians, Germans, Greeks, and Chinese all had versions of the seesaw (or teeter-totter, as it is also called). The Romans were the first, however, to set down any written record of them. Seesaws, it seems, were used in ancient Roman circuses—which had very violent exhibitions. Boxing matches to the death, crucifixions, military battles in which the soldiers actually killed each other—these were all part of the Roman circus events. Almost every act was brutal, and that goes for their seesaw act as well. Here's how it worked. In the middle of the arena a large seesaw was set up; at either end of the device was a basket big enough to hold a man. Two clowns were then shoved out into the arena. As fast as they could, they ran to the seesaw and hopped into the baskets—just as a lion was set free from a cage. The lion, which hadn't been fed for days, charged the seesaw. When it came toward one of the downs, he would push off the ground and up into the air. Then the animal would race toward the other down in the basket on the ground. And that down would immediately push off and shoot up, out of reach of the ravenous lion. Up and down they would go. The spectators thought this was great fun. For the downs, however, it wasn't fun at all. Eventually, they began to tire. One would sadly end up as a basket of food for the lion.

Some take a lot of time and attention and need a lot of space. Others can fit in a corner and don't need much care at all. Some live just a year or two. Others may still be alive when you leave home for good! Some may be happy to stay in a cage—others may mess on your carpets and scratch your couch. So. before your family rushes out to get a pet, why not sit down and talk? Ask your parents how they feel about it. The pet you want has to be one that they want too.

50,“Ancient Mound Builders.”,"Kavash, E. Barrie",b059_AncientMoundBuilders.txt,3,"More than 200 years after the Spanish had first encountered Natchez-related tribes along the southern Mississippi flood plains, European trappers and settlers seeking furs and good farmland began moving west of the Alleghenies into the Ohio River Valley. They discovered beautiful land, broad and lush with rolling prairies, acres upon acres of grasslands, and deep woods filled with game animals and fine trees. Along the way they came across numerous Indian camps and settlements where they stopped to trade and gain information about these new lands. Some of the Shawnee, Illini, and Miami Indians lived in summer camps along the fertile floodplains, where they tended cornfields and fished in the rivers. Other times the new corners encountered bands of hunters and traders, and Indian families in the winter camps making maple syrup and maple sugar. Amidst these abundant natural resources, the newcomers also discovered strange earthen forms all across the land. There were steep conical mounds and long linear earthworks, like giant snakes, enclosing some mounds. There were huge, steep platform mounds that were flat on top and even mounds in animal and human shapes. Who had built these mysterious earthworks the newcomers wondered? The Shawnee and Miami Indians living in these regions could not explain who had created them. An old Lenape (Delaware) legend told of how the Lenape and Iroquois People had attacked and driven an ancient powerful nation south of the Ohio River, who left behind the massive mounds. Others believed these were actually Cherokee ancestors, whose legends relate a southeastern migration from the Ohio valley. 
These massive earthworks seemed to be very old and otherworldly. Trees, hundreds of years old, grew up through some of them, so many observers surmised that they must have been created by a lost race"" that had vanished before the Shawnee and Miami came to live there. A few even suggested that extraterrestrials had made the great earthworks as landing devices. Most were convinced that the mounds were too sophisticated and the earthworks too mathematically correct to have been made by Indians. Evidently they had not seen or heard about the Natchez' mounds de Soto had come across, or if they had, they did not see the connection between those and the more massive and impressive mounds. Yet all could feel the sacred geography of the mounds!

51,About Time: A First Look at Time and Clocks,"Koscielniak, Bruce",b060_AboutTime.txt,3,"Sometime around 1440, the spring-powered clock was invented. Instead of depending on the pull of weights for power, this type of clock used a flat metal spring wound tightly into a coil. The escapement allowed the spring to unwind by turning one gear tooth at a time. With the use of a spring, smaller, truly portable clocks could be made. The first well-known watches, made in Germany around 1510 by Peter Henlein, were so named because guards or “watchmen” carried small clocks to keep track of how long to stay at a particular duty post. Many different skills went into making a clock, and new tools and methods were constantly being invented to make ever smaller, more complicated mechanisms that worked with greater precision. Founders melted and poured metal into a mold to make clock parts. Spring makers hand-forged (heated and pounded into shape) and polished steel clock springs. Screw makers cut screws used to fasten clocks together by using a small lathe devised by a German clockmaker in 1480. Earlier, only wedges or pegs were used. Gear-tooth cutting had been done by hand until the mid-1500s, when Giannelo Torriano of Cremona, Italy, invented a machine that could cut perfect gear teeth. Brass replaced iron for clock making. Engravers, gilders, and enamellers decorated clock cases and dials. Glass -making shops made and cut glass. Woodworkers made clock cases."
52,England the Land,"Banting, Erinn",b061_EnglandtheLand.txt,3,"Low fences, some of which are thousands of years old, divide much of England’s countryside. These fences, called hedgerows, were fist build by the Anglo-Saxons, a group of warriors from Germany and Scandinavia who arrived in England around 410 A.D. As they gained control of sections of land, they protected their property with walls made from wooden stakes and spiny plants. Dead hedgerows, as these fences were called, were eventually replaced by fences made from live bushes and trees. Recently, people building large farms and homes in the countryside have destroyed many live hedgerows. Other people are working to save the hedgerows, which are home to a variety of wildlife, including birds, butterflies, hedgehogs, and hares."

You’re 10 years old and able to work the controls yourself. So get going; we want to head northwest, to the very edge of the land, to the region that will be the states of Washington and Oregon. The time? We were in the 13th century; let’s try the 14th century for this visit. Life is easy for the Indians here in the Northwest near the great ocean. They are affluent (AF-flew-ent –it means “wealthy”) Americans. For them the world is bountiful: the rivers hold salmon and sturgeon; the ocean is full of seals, whales, fish, and shellfish; the woods are swarming with game animals. And there are berries and nuts and wild roots to be gathered. They are not farmers. They don’t need to farm. Those Americans go to sea in giant canoes; some are 60 feet long. (How long is your bedroom? Your schoolroom?) Using stone tools and fire, Indians of the Northwest cut down gigantic fir trees and hollow out the logs to make their boats. The trees tower 200 feet and are 10 feet across at the base. There are so many of them, so close together, with a tangle of undergrowth, that it is sometimes hard for hunters to get through the forest. Tall as these trees are, there are not as big as the redwoods that grow in a vast forest to the south (in the land that will become California)."
54,My Librarian Is a Camel: How Books Are Brought to Children Around the World,"Ruurs, Margriet",b063_MyLibrarianIsaCamel.txt,3,"Nunavut, which means ""Our Land"" in the language of the Inuit people, is a huge territory in Canada's north. The arctic region stretches from the North Pole to Arviat in the south, and from Kugluktuk in the west to Panjnirtung in the east. The distances are huge, and many villages are very isolated. The Northwest Territories reach from Nunavut in the east to the Yukon in the west. Larger towns like lqaluit, Tuktoyaktuk, and Yellowknife have their own public-library buildings, but many communities are just too small. Some communities, like Fort Liard, have a virtual library, which offers Internet access. But even if the community does not have any kind of library building, the Northwest Territories public library system offers books to everyone in the far north through their Borrower-by-Mail program. Tyson Anakvik, Colin Igutaaq, James Naikak, and Cameron Ovilok are friends in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. They request library books by e-mail or by phone. A mobile library doesn't bring the books to their village; the books are sent through the mail. The Borrower-by-Mail program will send children any books they'd like to read. 
Children in Peru can receive their book in several different, innovative ways. CEDILI-IBBY Peru is an institution that delivers books in bags to families in Lima. Each bag contains twenty books, which families can keep for a month. The books come in four different reading levels so that children really learn how to read. This project in Spanish is called El Libro Compartido en Familia and enables parents to share the joy of books with their children. In small, rural communities, books are delivered in wooden suitcases and plastic bags. These suitcases and bags contain books that the community can keep and share for the next three months. The number of books in each suitcase depends on the size of the community. There are no library buildings in these small towns, and people gather outside, in the plaza, to see books they can check out. In the coastal regions, books are sometimes delivered by donkey cart. The books are stored in the reading promoter’s home. In the ancient city of Cajamarca, reading promoters from various rural areas select and receive a large collection of books for their area. The program is called Aspaderuc. The reading promoter lends these books to his or her neighbors, and after three months, a new selection of books goes out to each area. Books in this system are for children and adults. And last but not least, Fe Y Alegria brings a collection of children’s books to rural schools. The books are brought from school to school by wagon. The children, who are excited about browsing through the books when they arrive, are turning into avid readers.

55,Horses,"Simon, Seymour",b064_Horses.txt,3,"Horses don't talk of course, but they communicate in other ways. They recognize each other by their scent. Friendly horses often groom each other by nuzzling their manes and necks. A horse moves its eyes and ears to show what it is feeling. When a horse lays back its ears and shows the whites of its eyes, it is angry or frightened. When the horse points its ears forward, it is interested in some object. When the horse lowers its ears, it is relaxed or sleeping. You can also tell that a horse is upset when it stamps a hind leg, shakes its head, and swishes its tail. Horses also make sounds such as neighing, nickering, and snorting. The sounds seem to show how the horse is feeling. Stallions try to show who is dominant (the leader) by fighting, rearing, and stabbing their front hooves or biting the neck of the other horse. Horses can sense when people are frightened or angry, perhaps by their smell. Touching, patting, and grooming build trust between a human and a horse.
Horses move in four natural ways, called gaits or paces. They walk, trot, canter, and gallop. The walk is the slowest gait and the gallop is the fastest. When a horse walks, each hoof leaves the ground at a different time. It moves one hind leg first, and then the front leg on the same side; then the other hind leg and the other front leg. When a horse walks, its body swings gently with each stride. When a horse trots, its legs move in pairs, left front leg with right hind leg, and right front leg with left hind leg. When a horse canters, the hind legs and one front leg move together, and then the hind legs and the other foreleg move together. The gallop is like a much faster walk, where each hoof hits the ground one after another. When a horse gallops, all four of its hooves may be flying off the ground at the same time. Horses are usually described by their coat colors and by the white markings on their faces, bodies, legs, and hooves. Brown horses range in color from dark brown bays and chestnuts to golden browns, such as palominos, and lighter browns such as roans and duns. Partly colored horses are called pintos or paints. Colorless, pure-white horses—albinos—are rare. Most horses that look white are actually gray. Skewbalds have brown-and-white patches. Piebalds have black and white patches. Spotteds have dark spots on a white coat or white spots on a dark coat.
In the 1800s, horses were used to transport settlers traveling westward across America in wagon trains, groups of horse-drawn covered wagons called prairie schooners. For centuries, horses have played a vital role in American history. Modern industry would not have been possible without the use of horse-power. Before the invention of steam engines and gasoline engines, horses turned the wheels that provided power for machines in factories. This is how products such as cotton materials, flour, and iron were manufactured. Horses pulled barges along canals and hauled fire engines, wagons, stage-coaches, and buses. In mines and forests, horses carried ore and logs. Like most Amish people, this lady still uses a horse-drawn plow. Today, machines mainly do the work that horses once did. But ""horsepower"" is still the term used to measure the pulling strength of a car, train, or plane engine. It seems that horses will always be with people in one way or another.

56,Quest for the Tree Kangaroo:An Expedition to the Cloud Forest of New Guinea,"Montgomery, Sy",b065_QuestfortheTree.txt,3,"Stuart Little, the small mouse with big parents, had nothing on baby marsupials. Marsupials (“mar-SOUP-ee-ulz”) are special kinds of mammals. Even the biggest ones give birth to babies that are incredibly small. A two-hundred-pound six-foot mother kangaroo, for instance, gives birth to a baby as small as a lima bean. That’s what makes marsupials marsupials. Their babies are born so tiny that in order to survive they must live in a pouch on the mother’s tummy. The pouch is called a marsupium. (Don’t you wish you had one?) A baby marsupial lives hidden in the mother’s warm moist pouch for months. There it sucks milk from a nipple like other baby mammals. One day it’s big enough to poke its head out to see the world. The European explorers who saw kangaroos for the first time in Australia reported they had discovered a two-headed animal—with one head on the neck and another in the belly. North America has only one marsupial. You may have seen it: The Virginia opossum actually lives in most of the United States, not just Virginia. South America also has marsupials. But most marsupials live in or near Australia. They include the koala (which is not a bear), two species of wombat, the toothy black Tasmania devil, four species of black and white spotted “native cats” (though they’re not cats at all), and many others. The most famous marsupials, however, are the kangaroos. All kangaroos hop—some of them six feet high and faster than forty miles an hour. More than fifty different species of kangaroo hop around on the ground—from the big red kangaroo to the musky rat kangaroo."
57,Volcanoes,"Simon, Seymour",b066_Volcanoes.txt,3,"In early times, no one knew how volcanoes formed or why they spouted red-hot molten rock. In modern times, scientists began to study volcanoes. They still don’t know all the answers, but they know much about how a volcano works. Our planet is made up of many layers of rock. The top layers of solid rock are called the crust. Deep beneath the crust is the mantle, where it is so hot that some rock melts. The melted, or molten, rock is called magma. Volcanoes are formed when magma pushes its way up through the crack in Earth’s crust. This is called a volcanic eruption. When magma pours forth on the surface, it is called lava.
In March 1980, Mount St. Helens awakened from its long sleep. Fust there were a few small earthquakes that shook the mountain. Then, on March 27, Mount St. Helens began to spout ash and steam. Each day brought fit ther earthquakes, until by mid-May more than ten thousand small earthquakes had been recorded. The mountain began to swell up and crack. Sunday, May 18, dawned bright and cleat The mountain seemed much the same as it had been ix the past month. Suddenly, at 8:32 AM., Mount St. Helens erupted with thardiblie force.

58,We Are the Ship: The Story of Negro League Baseball,"Nelson, Kadir",b067_WeAretheShip.txt,3,"Most of the owners didn’t make much money from their teams. Baseball was just a hobby for them, a way to make their illegal money look good. To save money, each team would only carry fifteen or sixteen players. The major league teams each carried about twenty-five. Average salary for each player started at roughly $125 per month back in ‘34, and went up to $500-$800 during the forties, though there were some who made much more than that, like Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson. The average major league player’s salary back then was $7,000 per month. We also got around fifty cents to a dollar per day for food allowance. Back then you could get a decent meal for about twenty-five cents to seventy-five cents. Some of the owners didn’t treat their players very well. Didn’t pay them enough or on time. That’s why we would jump from team to team. Other owners would offer us more money, and we would leave our teams and go play for them. We were some of the first unrestricted free agents. There were, however, a few owners who did know how to treat their ballplayers. Cum Posey was one of them. He always took care of his ballplayers, put them in the best hotels, and paid them well and on time. Buck Leonard said Posey never missed a payday in the seventeen years he played for the Grays."

60,“Seeing Eye to Eye.”,"Hall, Leslie",b069_SeeingEyetoEye.txt,3,"A hungry falcon soars high above Earth. Its sharp eyes scan the ground. Suddenly, it spies something moving in the grass. The falcon dives toward it. Far below, a gray field mouse scurries through the grass. Its dark, beady eyes search constantly for danger. With eyes on either side of its head, the mouse can see almost everything around it. Will the mouse see the falcon in time to escape? Or, will the speedy falcon catch the prey it spied from far above? Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Without eyes, neither animal has a good chance. Why? Eyes help many animals make sense of the world around them - and survive. Eyes can guide the falcon to dinner or help the mouse see a perfect place to hide. Animal eyes come in many different shapes, sizes, colors, and even numbers. Yet they do the same job. They all catch light. With help from the brain, eyes turn light into sight. Eyes work in the same way for people. Look at this page. You may think you see words and pictures. Believe it or not, you don’t. All you see is light bouncing off the page. How is this possible? The secret is in the rules of light. Light Rules Light is a form of energy, like heat or sound. It can come from a natural source, like the sun, or artificial sources, like a lamp or a flashlight. Light is the fastest known thing. It travels in waves and in nearly straight lines. In air, it can speed 299,700 kilometers (186,200 miles) per second. It can race from the sun to Earth in just over eight minutes! Light doesn’t always travel so fast. For example, water or glass can slow light down, but just a bit. Light may seem to break all driving speed laws. Yet there are certain rules it always follows. Light reflects, or bounces off objects. It also refracts, or bends. And it can be absorbed, or soaked up, by objects. These rules of light affect what, and how, we see. Light! Eyes! Imagine this scene: You’re at your desk happily reading Explorer magazine. Light from your desk lamp scatters in all directions. Light hits the page. Some bounces off the page, or reflects. It changes direction. It’s a little like how sound bounces off a wall. Now some of this reflected light is traveling right toward your face. Don’t duck! For you to see Explorer, some of this light has to enter your eyes. Objects become visible when light bounces off them. Your eyes are light catchers. Yet it takes more than catching light to see an image. Your eyes also have to bend light. Here’s how. First, light hits your cornea. That’s the clear covering on the front of your eyeball. The cornea refracts, or bends, light. And Action! Is your cornea super strong? No! Think about how light travels more slowly through water. The same thing happens in your cornea. As light passes through the cornea, it slows down. That makes the light change direction, or bend. Next, light enters your pupil, the dark center part of your eye. It passes through your lens. The lens bends light, too. What’s the big deal about bending light? That’s how your eyes focus, or aim the light to make a clear image. The image appears on your retina at the back of your eyeball. It’s like a movie. Playing Today at a Theater in Your Eye: Explorer magazine! There’s only one problem. The image is upside down. Luckily, your brain flips the image right side up. That’s pretty smart!"
61,“Telescopes.”,"Ronan, Colin A",b070_Telescopes.txt,3,"You can see planets, stars, and other objects in space just by looking up on a clear night. But to really see them--to observe the craters on the moon, the rings around Saturn, and the countless other wonders in our sky--you must use a telescope. A telescope is an instrument used to produce magnified (enlarged) images of distant objects. It does this by gathering and focusing the light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected by those objects. The word “telescope” comes from two Greek words meaning “far” and “see.” Kinds of Telescopes There are many different types of telescopes, both optical and non-optical. Optical telescopes are designed to focus visible light. Non-optical telescopes are designed to detect kinds of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye. These include radio waves, infrared radiation, X rays, ultraviolet radiation, and gamma rays. The word “optical” means “making use of light.” Some telescopes are launched into space. These telescopes gain clearer views. And they can collect forms of electromagnetic radiation that are absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere and do not reach the ground. Optical Telescopes Different types of optical telescopes gather and focus light in different ways. Refracting telescopes, or refractors, use lenses. Reflecting telescopes, or reflectors, use mirrors. And catadioptric telescopes, or catadioptrics, use a combination of lenses and mirrors. The main lens or mirror in an optical telescope is called the objective. Refracting Telescopes. A refracting telescope is typically a long, tube-shaped instrument. The objective is a system of lenses at the front end of the tube (the end facing the sky). When light strikes the lenses, it is bent and brought to a focus within the tube. This forms an image of a distant object. This image can be magnified by the eyepiece. This consists of a group of small lenses at the back of the tube. A camera can replace or be added to the eyepiece. Then photographs can be taken of celestial objects. For many years, these cameras used film. Today most are equipped with charge-coupled devices (CCD’s). These devices use semiconductor chips to electronically capture images. CCD’s are similar to the devices in home digital cameras and video camcorders. However, the CCD’s used by astronomers are usually extremely sensitive to light."
62,“Underground Railroad.”,"Buckmaster, Henrietta",b071_UndergroundRailroad.txt,3,"ONE HOT DAY in 1850, a man staggered out of woods, looked about him to get his bearings, and plunged down a lane toward the river. He had only a few moments of freedom before he heard the baying of hounds. But those few minutes were all he needed to splash up to his knees in the shallow stream and wade, half crouching, under the willow trees, then turn swiftly in the opposite direction. At length he submerged himself in the water, breathing through a hollow reed he held in his hand. The dogs tried desperately to pick up the scent but the water had destroyed it. Since the man had created a false scent before doubling back on his tracks, the shouting men and the milling dogs raced up the stream in the opposite direction. After a safe interval, the man scrambled up the bank and sat panting and shaking with nerves. He knew he had no time to waste. It was growing dark, and the darkness would help him. He waded across the stream and ran, crouching, through the cotton fields until he reached a footpath. The only guide he had was the North Star. The only friend he could trust in the whole world was himself. Yet his skin was black and this fact might betray him. The man was a fugitive slave and the entire law was arrayed against him. The roads were patrolled by armed men on horseback who kept a watch for such as he. Patrols shot first and asked questions second. The North Star was his hope . . . north . . . keep going north and eventually, if you do not die, you will find freedom. The man had had the nails of one foot torn out because he had tried to run away before. The toes ached now but he scarcely felt the pain. All night he stumbled through underbrush, ran along the side of the road. When he saw the first light of dawn, he drew some water from a well. Before he could lower the bucket again, a voice whispered. What you doing here? What you want? For answer, he struck out his fist, not even waiting to learn whether the questioner was white or Negro. Wait— you're a fool! The voice said more urgently. You can't get away in the daytime. Lay over. I'll get you some breakfast The voice belonged to a black man. Those two who crouched by the well, looking at each other, were both slaves. They understood without further words.
The runaway—we'll call him Jeb—spent the day hidden in an unused pigpen in the woods. He ate and slept. At night, his friend brought him some sow back and corn bread and showed him a short cut through the woods. He could not tell Jeb how far he was from the ""North."" Only Jeb's torn and exhausted feet and his fear could give him any sense of the distance. For another ten days Jeb lived in deadly danger. He existed as best he could. He once ate poisonous berries and nearly died, with no one to help. The next day he crept on a bare two miles, but he was not defeated. His pants were torn, his shirt was frayed. A slave gave him a better pair of pants. A woman flung him a coat. A white woman. . . . Another white woman saw him in a field, ducking down behind a wall. She had in her hand a bowl of table scraps for the chickens. She put the bowl on the wall and called softly, ""Come and get it."" A slave told him he was in Kentucky, close to the Ohio River. He almost fainted. Get across that river, and he'd be in the Promised Land—almost. Swim, his black friend told him. Ain't hard. Fix to cross over at Ripley and you'll see a light burning on a hill. That's friends. You won't have to worry no more. Jeb came to the river at twilight. Nothing ever looked so wide or so wet. Hiding in bushes, he stared at the river and then he lifted his eyes to the hills. He continued to stare at the hills. With the first darkness, a light flickered high on the crest of the hill. A friend or a decoy? He took the risk and slipped into the water. For a man who was weak and exhausted it was a hard swim. When he climbed out on the other bank he did not know whether he would be able to climb that hill. Over and over he repeated to himself: freedom freedom— freedom. It was the most beautiful sound in the world. In the state of Ohio were no slave whips, no slave shackles, no slave men. It gave Jeb strength. He climbed the steep road, and he stood for a moment by the garden gate looking south across that flowing river. He'd never go back.
The family who lived beyond the garden gate was named Rankin. Seven tall sons and a father were prepared at any time of the day or night to pass along a runaway. They passed this one along. But first they gave Jeb a meal, made him a bed of straw in the bottom of a wagon, and then, in the dead of night, a Rankin son hitched up the team and drove through the rutty darkness to the home of a friend. The friend was unsurprised and prepared. Since it was now nearly dawn, he hid Jeb in his barn, but that night he hitched up his team and drove Jeb another thirty miles. In Canada lay the only true safety, for slave masters and slave laws could reach into the North with a long arm. Five more days of hazard and hardship, of tenderness, care, and brotherly love, and then the wide expanse of Lake Erie danced in the sunlight. Jeb was smuggled aboard a ship and hidden under sacks of grain. When he stepped off the ship, he was a free man. 
This was the desire for freedom which sent more than two thousand slaves out of the South every year. This was the Underground Railroad. Slavery had lain like a terrible sore on our country for two hundred years. Many were ashamed of it. The black Africans who were enslaved fought against it from the start. Men like Thomas Jefferson, preparing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, tried to have slavery outlawed. It was well on its way to extinction when a machine was invented in the late eighteenth century. The cotton gin. This machine cleaned five hundred pounds of cotton a day instead of the five that a man could do by hand. To grow the cotton to feed the machine, plantation owners needed labor—cheap labor. That settled the fate of slavery. To abolish slavery meant to abolish profits which were astronomical, profits which were shared North and South. But not to abolish slavery struck at some of the deepest principles of Americans. For the next sixty years—until the crash of the Civil War—no issue was as important as slavery. It divided homes, it spoke for the conscience, it made political parties, it challenged religion, it turned men into brutes and it turned men into heroes. It created the Underground Railroad. The first slave who helped a fellow slave to escape drove the first spike in this invisible railroad. The unknown first fugitive, the softly stepping men and women who dared the dangers of swamps and mountains and of cold and rain, the outstretched hands of friends, the disguises, the courage, the gunshots along the border, and a long invisible ""train"" which chugged so silently and sent up such invisible smoke—all these proved in the end irresistible. It was they which really broke the chains of slavery.

""Jo! Jo! Where are you?"" cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.
""Here!"" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.
""Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night!"" cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.
""'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go, now what shall we wear?""
""What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins, because we haven't got anything else?"" answered Jo with her mouth full.
""If I only had a silk!"" sighed Meg. ""Mother says I may when I'm eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.""
""I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.""
""You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.""
""Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall have to go without,"" said Jo, who never troubled herself much about dress.
""You must have gloves, or I won't go,"" cried Meg decidedly. ""Gloves are more important than anything else. You can't dance without them, and if you don't I should be so mortified.""
""Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing. It's no fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.""
""You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't get you any more this winter. Can't you make them do?""
""I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are. That's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don't you see?""
""Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove dreadfully,"" began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.
""Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say!"" cried Jo, taking up her book.
""You may have it, you may! Only don't stain it, and do behave nicely. Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say 'Christopher Columbus!' will you?""
""Don't worry about me. I'll be as prim as I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me finish this splendid story.""
So Meg went away to 'accept with thanks', look over her dress, and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.
On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'. Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.
""Ought they to smoke like that?"" asked Beth from her perch on the bed.
""It's the dampness drying,"" replied Jo.
""What a queer smell! It's like burned feathers,"" observed Amy, smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.
""There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little ringlets,"" said Jo, putting down the tongs.
She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.
""Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I'm spoiled! I can't go! My hair, oh, my hair!"" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.
""Just my luck! You shouldn't have asked me to do it. I always spoil everything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a mess,"" groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret.
""It isn't spoiled. Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've seen many girls do it so,"" said Amy consolingly.
""Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,"" cried Meg petulantly.
""So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,"" said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.
After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect ""quite easy and fine"". Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.
""Have a good time, dearies!"" said Mrs. March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk. ""Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you."" As the gate clashed behind them, a voice cried from a window...
""Girls, girls! Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?""
""Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers,"" cried Jo, adding with a laugh as they went on, ""I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.""
""It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"" replied Meg, who had a good many little 'aristocratic tastes' of her own.
""Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash right? And does my hair look very bad?"" said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.
""I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you?"" returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.
""No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. It isn't the thing.""
""How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music gay?""
Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'.
""Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!"" stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.
But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled, ""Don't mind me, stay if you like.""
""Shan't I disturb you?""
""Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people and felt rather strange at first, you know.""
""So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.""
The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to be polite and easy, ""I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don't you?""
""Next door."" And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.
That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, ""We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.""
""Grandpa sent it.""
""But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?""
""How is your cat, Miss March?"" asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun.
""Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,"" returned the young lady.
""I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.""
""Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.""
""My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.""
""I hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?""
""I thrashed 'em.""
""I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it."" And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.
""Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?"" asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her.
""I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?""
""Sometimes. You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.""
""Abroad!"" cried Jo. ""Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.""
Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.
""Don't I wish I'd been there!"" cried Jo. ""Did you go to Paris?""
""We spent last winter there.""
""Can you talk French?""
""We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.""
""Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.""
""Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?""
""How nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, 'Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers', didn't you?""
""Oui, mademoiselle.""
""It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty?""
""Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady.""
Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.
""Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?""
It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.
""I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your books, no, I mean studying hard."" And Jo blushed at the dreadful 'pegging' which had escaped her.
Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug. ""Not for a year or two. I won't go before seventeen, anyway.""
""Aren't you but fifteen?"" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already.
""Sixteen, next month.""
""How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.""
""I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way fellows do either, in this country.""
""What do you like?""
""To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.""
Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, ""That's a splendid polka! Why don't you go and try it?""
""If you will come too,"" he answered, with a gallant little bow.
""I can't, for I told Meg I wouldn't, because..."" There Jo stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.
""Because, what?""
""You won't tell?""
""Never!""
""Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.""
But Laurie didn't laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, ""Never mind that. I'll tell you how we can manage. There's a long hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.""
Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.
""I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever going to get home,"" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.
""I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all night,"" answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.
""I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send.""
""I'll go.""
""No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.""
""I'll ask Laurie. He will go,"" said Jo, looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.
""Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put these slippers with our things. I can't dance anymore, but as soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.""
""They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you. I'd rather.""
""No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired I can't stir.""
So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.
""Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!"" exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove by scrubbing her gown with it.
""Can I help you?"" said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.
""I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state,"" answered Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.
""Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister?""
""Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.""
Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a 'nice boy'. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of Buzz, with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.
""Hush! Don't say anything,"" she whispered, adding aloud, ""It's nothing. I turned my foot a little, that's all,"" and limped upstairs to put her things on.
Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just come for him, he said.
""It's so early! You can't mean to go yet?"" began Jo, looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.
""I always go early, I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.""
That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in freedom.
""I had a capital time. Did you?"" asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and making herself comfortable.
""Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,"" answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.
""I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from. Was he nice?""
""Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I had a delicious redowa with him.""
""He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie and I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us?""
""No, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time, hidden away there?""
Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...
""Tell about the party! Tell about the party!""
With what Meg called 'a great want of manners' Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.
""I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me,"" said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair.
""I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them."" And I think Jo was quite right.




CHAPTER FOUR
BURDENS
""Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,"" sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked.
""I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be fun?"" answered Jo, yawning dismally.
""We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so fond of luxury,"" said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.
""Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan't mind her.""
This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.
""Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not?"" she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. ""I shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do. It's a shame!""
So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak.
Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers. Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready.
Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't suit her.
""There never was such a cross family!"" cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon her hat.
""You're the crossest person in it!"" returned Amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.
""Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them drowned,"" exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.
Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.
""Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry,"" cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.
There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them 'muffs', for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.
Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.
""Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Goodbye, Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular angels. Now then, Meg!"" And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.
They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.
""If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,"" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.
""Don't use such dreadful expressions,"" replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.
""I like good strong words that mean something,"" replied Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether.
""Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don't choose to be called so.""
""You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with.""
""How ridiculous you are, Jo!"" But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.
""Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but come home jolly, there's a dear.""
Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.
When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.
Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was 'fond of luxury', and her chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.
Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but the unworldly Marches only said...
""We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another.""
The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.
I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her.
The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, ""Josy-phine! Josy-phine!"" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.
Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual ""Josy-phine!""
Beth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, ""I hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.""
Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often 'wept a little weep' as Jo said, because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, ""I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm good.""
There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.
If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, ""My nose."" When she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor 'Petrea's', it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.
""Little Raphael,"" as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, ""When Papa was rich we did so-and-so,"" which was very touching, and her long words were considered 'perfectly elegant' by the girls.
Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her cousin's clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.
""My only comfort,"" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, ""is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria Parks's mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky-rockets on it.""
Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way, 'playing mother' they called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.
""Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm really dying for some amusement,"" said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.
""I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'll tell you about it,"" began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. ""I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.""
""I wish I could, and be done with it,"" said I, trying not to be saucy.
""Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said...
""'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'""
""Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly, 'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop now?'""
""She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, 'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'.""
""Did she own she liked it?"" asked Meg.
""Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have if only she chose! I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think,"" added Jo.
""That reminds me,"" said Meg, ""that I've got something to tell. It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.""
""I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do,"" said Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. ""Susie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, 'Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh, what do you think he did? He took her by the ear—the ear! Just fancy how horrid!—and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see.""
""Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?"" asked Jo, who relished the scrape.
""Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification."" And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.
""I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at dinner, but I forgot,"" said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. ""When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy'.""
When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, ""As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.
""'Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought was not to me.""
""Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.' he answered quietly.""
""'You have done a great deal for your country, sir,' I said, feeling respect now, instead of pity.""
""'Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any use. As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'""
""He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.""
""Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,"" said Jo, after a minute's silence.
Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.
""Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented."" (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew diligently.) ""These girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly saying, 'If only we had this,' or 'If we could only do that,' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, 'When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'"" (Here Jo looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)
""Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses, another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.""
""Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!"" cried Meg.
""I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort Father used to tell us,"" said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.
""I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall,"" said Amy morally.
""We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do so, you just say to us, as old Chloe did in Uncle Tom, 'Tink ob yer marcies, chillen!' 'Tink ob yer marcies!'"" added Jo, who could not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.




CHAPTER FIVE
BEING NEIGHBORLY
""What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?"" asked Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.
""Going out for exercise,"" answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.
""I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do,"" said Meg with a shiver.
""Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and not being a pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm going to find some.""
Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.
Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.
To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.
""That boy is suffering for society and fun,"" she said to herself. ""His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!""
The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of 'going over' was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet, curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.
""There he is,"" thought Jo, ""Poor boy! All alone and sick this dismal day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.""
Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her broom as she called out...
""How do you do? Are you sick?""
Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...
""Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.""
""I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?""
""Nothing. It's dull as tombs up here.""
""Don't you read?""
""Not much. They won't let me.""
""Can't somebody read to you?""
""Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and I hate to ask Brooke all the time.""
""Have someone come and see you then.""
""There isn't anyone I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.""
""Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet and like to play nurse.""
""Don't know any.""
""You know us,"" began Jo, then laughed and stopped.
""So I do! Will you come, please?"" cried Laurie.
""I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.""
With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was 'a little gentleman', and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, than a decided voice, asking for 'Mr. Laurie', and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.
""All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo,"" said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens in the other.
""Here I am, bag and baggage,"" she said briskly. ""Mother sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse, she was so anxious to do something.""
It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.
""That looks too pretty to eat,"" he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blanc mange, surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.
""It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. What a cozy room this is!""
""It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't know how to make them mind. It worries me though.""
""I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth brushed, so—and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so—and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now then, you're fixed.""
And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...
""How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.""
""No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?"" and Jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.
""Thank you! I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather talk,"" answered Laurie.
""Not a bit. I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I never know when to stop.""
""Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket?"" asked Laurie with interest.
""Yes, that's Beth. She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.""
""The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?""
""How did you find that out?""
Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, ""Why, you see I often hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know."" And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.
The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart. She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said...
""We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you?""
""I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers,"" began Laurie, brightening more and more.
""We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be a bother. We want to know you, and I've been trying to do it this ever so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.""
""You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as I can.""
""That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last long if you keep going.""
Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.
""Do you like your school?"" asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.
""Don't go to school, I'm a businessman—girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"" answered Jo.
Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.
Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where she reveled.
Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter.
""Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,"" he said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.
Much elated with her success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.
""If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out, so you needn't be afraid,"" said Laurie, getting up.
""I'm not afraid of anything,"" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.
""I don't believe you are!"" exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his moods.
The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.
""What richness!"" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. ""Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"" she added impressively.
""A fellow can't live on books,"" said Laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite.
Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, ""Mercy me! It's your grandpa!""
""Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,"" returned the boy, looking wicked.
""I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for it,"" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.
""I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, I couldn't bear to stop,"" said Laurie gratefully.
""The doctor to see you, sir,"" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.
""Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,"" said Laurie.
""Don't mind me. I'm happy as a cricket here,"" answered Jo.
Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, ""I'm sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.""
""Thank you, ma'am,"" said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.
Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, ""So you're not afraid of me, hey?""
""Not much, sir.""
""And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?""
""Not quite, sir.""
""And I've got a tremendous will, have I?""
""I only said I thought so.""
""But you like me in spite of it?""
""Yes, I do, sir.""
That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh, shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, ""You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.""
""Thank you, sir,"" And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly.
""What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?"" was the next question, sharply put.
""Only trying to be neighborly, sir."" And Jo told how her visit came about.
""You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?""
""Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,"" said Jo eagerly.
""Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman?""
""Doing nicely, sir."" And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.
""Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea bell, we have it early on the boy's account. Come down and go on being neighborly.""
""If you'd like to have me, sir.""
""Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't."" And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.
""What would Meg say to this?"" thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.
""Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?"" said the old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.
""I didn't know you'd come, sir,"" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant little glance.
""That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman."" And having pulled the boy's hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.
The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.
""She's right, the lad is lonely. I'll see what these little girls can do for him,"" thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.
If the Laurences had been what Jo called 'prim and poky', she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, ""Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.""
They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which stood open.
""Do you play?"" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful expression.
""Sometimes,"" he answered modestly.
""Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.""
""Won't you first?""
""Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.""
So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the 'Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.
""That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to you, and I hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.""
He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something amiss. He shook his head.
""No, it was me. He doesn't like to hear me play.""
""Why not?""
""I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't.""
""No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take care of yourself, won't you?""
""Yes, but you will come again, I hope?""
""If you promise to come and see us after you are well.""
""I will.""
""Good night, Laurie!""
""Good night, Jo, good night!""
When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.
""Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"" asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.
""I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he 'glowered' as Jo said.""
""Dear me, how romantic!"" exclaimed Meg.
""How silly!"" said Jo. ""Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.""
""That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I suppose. Italians are always nice,"" said Meg, who was a little sentimental.
""What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to him, hardly,"" cried Jo, who was not sentimental.
""I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent him.""
""He meant the blanc mange, I suppose.""
""How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.""
""Did he?"" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.
""I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get it,"" said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.
""I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother, and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?""
""Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.""
""I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,"" observed Amy. ""What do you say, Beth?""
""I was thinking about our 'Pilgrim's Progress',"" answered Beth, who had not heard a word. ""How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.""
""We have got to get by the lions first,"" said Jo, as if she rather liked the prospect.

64,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"Twain, Mark",b073_TheAdventuresofTomSawyer.txt,4,"""TOM!""
No answer.
""TOM!""
No answer.
""What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!""
No answer.
The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for ""style,"" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove–lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:
""Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—""
She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
""I never did see the beat of that boy!""
She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and ""jimpson"" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:
""Y–o–u–u TOM!""
There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
""There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?""
""Nothing.""
""Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS that truck?""
""I don't know, aunt.""
""Well, I know. It's jam—that's what it is. Forty times I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.""
The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—
""My! Look behind you, aunt!""
The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board–fence, and disappeared over it.
His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.
""Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws–a–me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well–a–well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for ""afternoon""] I'll just be obleeged to make him work, to–morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child.""
Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next–day's wood and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three–fourths of the work. Tom's younger brother (or rather half–brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, troublesome ways.
While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other simple–hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:
""Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?""
""Yes'm.""
""Powerful warm, warn't it?""
""Yes'm.""
""Didn't you want to go in a–swimming, Tom?""
A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
""No'm—well, not very much.""
The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:
""But you ain't too warm now, though."" And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
""Some of us pumped on our heads—mine's damp yet. See?""
Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:
""Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!""
The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.
""Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a–swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is—better'n you look. THIS time.""
She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
But Sidney said:
""Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's black.""
""Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!""
But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
""Siddy, I'll lick you for that.""
In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said:
""She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other—I can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!""
He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well though—and loathed him.
Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird–like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.
The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger than himself. A new–comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week–day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close–buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:
""I can lick you!""
""I'd like to see you try it.""
""Well, I can do it.""
""No you can't, either.""
""Yes I can.""
""No you can't.""
""I can.""
""You can't.""
""Can!""
""Can't!""
An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
""What's your name?""
""'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.""
""Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business.""
""Well why don't you?""
""If you say much, I will.""
""Much—much—MUCH. There now.""
""Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.""
""Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it.""
""Well I WILL, if you fool with me.""
""Oh yes—I've seen whole families in the same fix.""
""Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a hat!""
""You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off—and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.""
""You're a liar!""
""You're another.""
""You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.""
""Aw—take a walk!""
""Say—if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head.""
""Oh, of COURSE you will.""
""Well I WILL.""
""Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will for? Why don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid.""
""I AIN'T afraid.""
""You are.""
""I ain't.""
""You are.""
Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
""Get away from here!""
""Go away yourself!""
""I won't.""
""I won't either.""
So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:
""You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.""
""What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger than he is—and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too."" [Both brothers were imaginary.]
""That's a lie.""
""YOUR saying so don't make it so.""
Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
""I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.""
The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
""Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.""
""Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.""
""Well, you SAID you'd do it—why don't you do it?""
""By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it.""
The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. ""Holler 'nuff!"" said he.
The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying—mainly from rage.
""Holler 'nuff!""—and the pounding went on.
At last the stranger got out a smothered ""'Nuff!"" and Tom let him up and said:
""Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next time.""
The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the ""next time he caught him out."" To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he ""'lowed"" to ""lay"" for that boy.
He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.
SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust–trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long–handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far–reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree–box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:
""Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.""
Jim shook his head and said:
""Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business—she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de whitewashin'.""
""Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket—I won't be gone only a a minute. SHE won't ever know.""
""Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me. 'Deed she would.""
""SHE! She never licks anybody—whacks 'em over the head with her thimble—and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but talk don't hurt—anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white alley!""
Jim began to waver.
""White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.""
""My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful 'fraid ole missis—""
""And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.""
Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.
He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the hop–skip–and–jump—proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep–toned ding–dong–dong, ding–dong–dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine–bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane–deck giving the orders and executing them:
""Stop her, sir! Ting–a–ling–ling!"" The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
""Ship up to back! Ting–a–ling–ling!"" His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.
""Set her back on the stabboard! Ting–a–ling–ling! Chow! ch–chow–wow! Chow!"" His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles—for it was representing a forty–foot wheel.
""Let her go back on the labboard! Ting–a–lingling! Chow–ch–chow–chow!"" The left hand began to describe circles.
""Stop the stabboard! Ting–a–ling–ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting–a–ling–ling! Chow–ow–ow! Get out that head–line! LIVELY now! Come—out with your spring–line—what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now—let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting–a–ling–ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!"" (trying the gauge–cocks).
Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: ""Hi–YI! YOU'RE up a stump, ain't you!""
No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:
""Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?""
Tom wheeled suddenly and said:
""Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.""
""Say—I'm going in a–swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd druther WORK—wouldn't you? Course you would!""
Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
""What do you call work?""
""Why, ain't THAT work?""
Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
""Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.""
""Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?""
The brush continued to move.
""Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?""
That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:
""Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little.""
Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
""No—no—I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know —but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done.""
""No—is that so? Oh come, now—lemme just try. Only just a little—I'd let YOU, if you was me, Tom.""
""Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly—well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it—""
""Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say—I'll give you the core of my apple.""
""Well, here—No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard—""
""I'll give you ALL of it!""
Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty–stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews–harp, a piece of blue bottle–glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire–crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog–collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange–peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.
He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company —and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread–mill is work, while rolling ten–pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four–horse passenger–coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.
The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.
TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast–room, dining–room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting —for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: ""Mayn't I go and play now, aunt?""
""What, a'ready? How much have you done?""
""It's all done, aunt.""
""Tom, don't lie to me—I can't bear it.""
""I ain't, aunt; it IS all done.""
Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:
""Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a mind to, Tom."" And then she diluted the compliment by adding, ""But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.""
She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he ""hooked"" a doughnut.
Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail–storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.
Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow–stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two ""military"" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides–de–camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and hard–fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden—a lovely little blue–eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long–tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. The fresh–crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.
He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to ""show off"" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by–and–by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.
The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, ""showing off,"" as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.
All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered ""what had got into the child."" He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
""Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.""
""Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into that sugar if I warn't watching you.""
Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar–bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model ""catch it."" He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, ""Now it's coming!"" And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:
""Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for?—Sid broke it!""
Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she got her tongue again, she only said:
""Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.""
Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age–long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.
He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.
About half–past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second–story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death–damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?
The window went up, a maid–servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.
Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he had any dim idea of making any ""references to allusions,"" he thought better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.
Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental note of the omission.
ABOUT half–past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The Sunday–school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good–hearted soul and well–to–do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn–clad and ribbon–decked young heart–breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane–heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been ""thrown up to them"" so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays—accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys who had as snobs.
The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill–bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.
The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring–board:
Shall I be car–ri–ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of ease,
Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOODY seas?
He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church ""sociables"" he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and ""wall"" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, ""Words cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.""
After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin–board, and read off ""notices"" of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.
There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously —for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat–tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the ""Amen"" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.
The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod —and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on–looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.
Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a ""pinchbug,"" he called it. It was in a percussion–cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent–minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore–paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home–stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.
By this time the whole church was red–faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew–back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.
MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found him so—because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.
Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a ""starter,"" as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.
But Sid slept on unconscious.
Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
No result from Sid.
Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
Sid snored on.
Tom was aggravated. He said, ""Sid, Sid!"" and shook him. This course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:
""Tom! Say, Tom!"" [No response.] ""Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter, Tom?"" And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
Tom moaned out:
""Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.""
""Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.""
""No—never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.""
""But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this way?""
""Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.""
""Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?""
""I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done to me. When I'm gone—""
""Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom—oh, don't. Maybe—""
""I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my window–sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town, and tell her—""
But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.
Sid flew down–stairs and said:
""Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!""
""Dying!""
""Yes'm. Don't wait—come quick!""
""Rubbage! I don't believe it!""
But she fled up–stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bedside she gasped out:
""You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?""
""Oh, auntie, I'm—""
""What's the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?""
""Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!""
The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
""Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this.""
The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little foolish, and he said:
""Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.""
""Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?""
""One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.""
""There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well—your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.""
Tom said:
""Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay home from school.""
""Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a–fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness."" By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.
But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, ""Sour grapes!"" and he wandered away a dismantled hero.
Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast–off clothes of full–grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.
Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
Tom hailed the romantic outcast:
""Hello, Huckleberry!""
""Hello yourself, and see how you like it.""
""What's that you got?""
""Dead cat.""
""Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?""
""Bought him off'n a boy.""
""What did you give?""
""I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter–house.""
""Where'd you get the blue ticket?""
""Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop–stick.""
""Say—what is dead cats good for, Huck?""
""Good for? Cure warts with.""
""No! Is that so? I know something that's better.""
""I bet you don't. What is it?""
""Why, spunk–water.""
""Spunk–water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk–water.""
""You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?""
""No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.""
""Who told you so!""
""Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!""
""Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don't know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN'T lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.""
""Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain–water was.""
""In the daytime?""
""Certainly.""
""With his face to the stump?""
""Yes. Least I reckon so.""
""Did he say anything?""
""I don't reckon he did. I don't know.""
""Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk–water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a–going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a spunk–water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:
'Barley–corn, barley–corn, injun–meal shorts, Spunk–water, spunk–water, swaller these warts,'
and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted.""
""Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner done.""
""No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunk–water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.""
""Yes, bean's good. I've done that.""
""Have you? What's your way?""
""You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.""
""Yes, that's it, Huck—that's it; though when you're burying it if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say—how do you cure 'em with dead cats?""
""Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch ANY wart.""
""Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?""
""No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.""
""Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.""
""Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a–witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.""
""Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a–witching him?""
""Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they're a–witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.""
""Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?""
""To–night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to–night.""
""But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?""
""Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?—and THEN it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't reckon.""
""I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?""
""Of course—if you ain't afeard.""
""Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?""
""Yes—and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me a–meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window—but don't you tell.""
""I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but I'll meow this time. Say—what's that?""
""Nothing but a tick.""
""Where'd you get him?""
""Out in the woods.""
""What'll you take for him?""
""I don't know. I don't want to sell him.""
""All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.""
""Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.""
""Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I wanted to.""
""Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.""
""Say, Huck—I'll give you my tooth for him.""
""Less see it.""
Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
""Is it genuwyne?""
Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
""Well, all right,"" said Huckleberry, ""it's a trade.""
Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion–cap box that had lately been the pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.
When Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse, he strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business–like alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint–bottom arm–chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.
""Thomas Sawyer!""
Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
""Sir!""
""Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?""
Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the girls' side of the schoolhouse. He instantly said:
""I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!""
The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The master said:
""You—you did what?""
""Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.""
There was no mistaking the words.
""Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket.""
The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:
""Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.""
The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.
By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, ""made a mouth"" at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, ""Please take it—I got more."" The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:
""Let me see it.""
Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:
""It's nice—make a man.""
The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
""It's a beautiful man—now make me coming along.""
Tom drew an hour–glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
""It's ever so nice—I wish I could draw.""
""It's easy,"" whispered Tom, ""I'll learn you.""
""Oh, will you? When?""
""At noon. Do you go home to dinner?""
""I'll stay if you will.""
""Good—that's a whack. What's your name?""
""Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.""
""That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me Tom, will you?""
""Yes.""
Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:
""Oh, it ain't anything.""
""Yes it is.""
""No it ain't. You don't want to see.""
""Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.""
""You'll tell.""
""No I won't—deed and deed and double deed won't.""
""You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?""
""No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.""
""Oh, YOU don't want to see!""
""Now that you treat me so, I WILL see."" And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: ""I LOVE YOU.""
""Oh, you bad thing!"" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.
Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got ""turned down,"" by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.

65,A Wrinkle in Time,"L’Engle, Madeleine",b074_AWrinkleinTime.txt,4,"It was a dark and stormy night. In her attic bedroom Margaret Murry, wrapped in an old patchwork quilt, sat on the foot of her bed and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind. Behind the trees clouds scudded frantically across the sky. Every few moments the moon ripped through them, creating wraithlike shadows that raced along the ground. The house shook. Wrapped in her quilt, Meg shook. She wasn’t usually afraid of weather.—It’s not just the weather, she thought.—It’s the weather on top of everything else. On top of me. On top of Meg Murry doing everything wrong. School. School was all wrong. She’d been dropped down to the lowest section in her grade. That morning one of her teachers had said crossly, “Really, Meg, I don’t understand how a child with parents as brilliant as yours are supposed to be can be such a poor student. If you don’t manage to do a little better you’ll have to stay back next year.” During lunch she’d rough-housed a little to try to make herself feel better, and one of the girls said scornfully, “After all, Meg, we aren’t grammar-school kids anymore. Why do you always act like such a baby?” And on the way home from school, walking up the road with her arms full of books, one of the boys had said something about her “dumb baby brother.” At this she’d thrown the books on the side of the road and tackled him with every ounce of strength she had, and arrived home with her blouse torn and a big bruise under one eye. Sandy and Dennys, her ten-year-old twin brothers, who got home from school an hour earlier than she did, were disgusted. “Let us do the fighting when it’s necessary,” they told her. —A delinquent, that’s what I am, she thought grimly.—That’s what they’ll be saying next. Not Mother. But Them. Everybody Else. I wish Father— But it was still not possible to think about her father without the danger of tears. Only her mother could talk about him in a natural way, saying, “When your father gets back—” Gets back from where? And when? Surely her mother must know what people were saying, must be aware of the smugly vicious gossip. Surely it must hurt her as it did Meg. But if it did she gave no outward sign. Nothing ruffled the serenity of her expression. —Why can’t I hide it, too? Meg thought. Why do I always have to show everything? The window rattled madly in the wind, and she pulled the quilt close about her. Curled up on one of her pillows a gray fluff of kitten yawned, showing its pink tongue, tucked its head under again, and went back to sleep. Everybody was asleep. Everybody except Meg. EvenCharles Wallace, the “dumb baby brother,” who had an uncanny way of knowing when she was awake and unhappy, and who would come, so many nights, tiptoeing up the attic stairs to her—even Charles Wallace was asleep. How could they sleep? All day on the radio there had been hurricane warnings. How could they leave her up in the attic in the rickety brass bed, knowing that the roof might be blown right off the house, and she tossed out into the wild night sky to land who knows where? Her shivering grew uncontrollable. —You asked to have the attic bedroom, she told herself savagely.—Mother let you have it because you’re the oldest. It’s a privilege, not a punishment. “Not during a hurricane, it isn’t a privilege,” she said aloud. She tossed the quilt down on the foot of the bed, and stood up. The kitten stretched luxuriously, and looked up at her with huge, innocent eyes. “Go back to sleep,” Meg said. “Just be glad you’re a kitten and not a monster like me.” She looked at herself in the wardrobe mirror and made a horrible face, baring a mouthful of teeth covered with braces. Automatically she pushed her glasses into position, ran her fingers through her mouse-brown hair, so that it stood wildly on end, and let out a sigh almost as noisy as the wind. The wide wooden floorboards were cold against her feet. Wind blew in the crevices about the window frame, in spite of the protection the storm sash was supposed to offer. She could hear wind howling in the chimneys. From all the way downstairs she could hear Fortinbras, the big black dog, starting to bark. He must be frightened, too. What was he barking at? Fortinbras never barked without reason. Suddenly she remembered that when she had gone to the post office to pick up the mail she’d heard about a tramp who was supposed to have stolen twelve sheets from Mrs. Buncombe, the constable’s wife. They hadn’t caught him, and maybe he was heading for the Murrys’ house right now, isolated on a back road as it was; and this time maybe he’d be after more than sheets. Meg hadn’t paid much attention to the talk about the tramp at the time, because the postmistress, with a sugary smile, had asked if she’d heard from her father lately. She left her little room and made her way through the shadows of the main attic, bumping against the ping-pong table.—Now I’ll have a bruise on my hip on top of everything else, she thought. Next she walked into her old dolls’ house, Charles Wallace’s rocking horse, the twins’ electric trains. “Why must everything happen to me?” She demanded of a large teddy bear. At the foot of the attic stairs she stood still and listened. Not a sound from Charles Wallace’s room on the right. On the left, in her parents’ room, not a rustle from her mother sleeping alone in the great double bed. She tiptoed down the hall and into the twins’ room, pushing again at her glasses as though they could help her to see better in the dark. Dennys was snoring. Sandy murmured something about baseball and subsided. The twins didn’t have any problems. They weren’t great students, but they weren’t bad ones, either. They were perfectly content with a succession of B’s and an occasional A or C. They were strong and fast runners and good at games, and when cracks were made about anybody in the Murry family, they weren’t made about Sandy and Dennys. She left the twins’ room and went on downstairs, avoiding the creaking seventh step. Fortinbras had stopped barking. It wasn’t the tramp this time, then. Fort would go on barking if anybody was around. —But suppose the tramp does come? Suppose he has a knife? Nobody lives near enough to hear if we screamed and screamed and screamed. Nobody’d care, anyhow. —I’ll make myself some cocoa, she decided.—That’ll cheer me up, and if the roof blows off at least I won’t go off with it. In the kitchen a light was already on, and Charles Wallace was sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam. He looked very small and vulnerable sitting there alone in the big old-fashioned kitchen, a blond little boy in faded blue Dr. Dentons, his feet swinging a good six inches above the floor. “Hi,” he said cheerfully. “I’ve been waiting for you.” From under the table where he was lying at Charles Wallace’s feet, hoping for a crumb or two, Fortinbras raised his slender dark head in greeting to Meg, and his tail thumped against the floor. Fortinbras had arrived on their doorstep, a half-grown puppy, scrawny and abandoned, one winter night. He was, Meg’s father had decided, part Llewellyn setter and part greyhound, and he had a slender, dark beauty that was all his own. “Why didn’t you come up to the attic?” Meg asked her brother, speaking as though he were at least her own age. “I’ve been scared stiff.” “Too windy up in that attic of yours,” the little boy said. “I knew you’d be down. I put some milk on the stove for you. It ought to be hot by now.” How did Charles Wallace always know about her? How could he always tell? He never knew—or seemed to care—what Dennys or Sandy were thinking. It was his mother’s mind, and Meg’s, that he probed with frightening accuracy. Was it because people were a little afraid of him that they whispered about the Murrys’ youngest child, who was rumored to be not quite bright? “I’ve heard that clever people often have subnormal children,” Meg had once overheard. “The two boys seem to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly aren’t all there.” It was true that Charles Wallace seldom spoke when anybody was around, so that many people thought he’d never learned to talk. And it was true that he hadn’t talked at all until he was almost four. Meg would turn white with fury when people looked at him and clucked, shaking their heads sadly. “Don’t worry about Charles Wallace, Meg,” her father had once told her. Meg remembered it very clearly because it was shortly before he went away. “There’s nothing the matter with his mind. He just does things in his own way and in his own time.” “I don’t want him to grow up to be dumb like me,” Meg had said. “Oh, my darling, you’re not dumb,” her father answered. “You’re like Charles Wallace. Your development has to go at its own pace. It just doesn’t happen to be the usual pace.” “How do you know?” Meg had demanded. “How do youknow I’m not dumb? Isn’t it just because you love me?” “I love you, but that’s not what tells me. Mother and I’ve given you a number of tests, you know.” Yes, that was true. Meg had realized that some of the “games” her parents played with her were tests of some kind, and that there had been more for her and Charles Wallace than for the twins. “IQ tests, you mean?” “Yes, some of them.” “Is my IQ okay?” “More than okay.” “What is it?” “That I’m not going to tell you. But it assures me that both you and Charles Wallace will be able to do pretty much whatever you like when you grow up to yourselves. You just wait till Charles Wallace starts to talk. You’ll see.” How right he had been about that, though he himself had left before Charles Wallace began to speak, suddenly, with none of the usual baby preliminaries, using entire sentences. How proud he would have been! “You’d better check the milk,” Charles Wallace said to Meg now, his diction clearer and cleaner than that of most five-year-olds. “You know you don’t like it when it gets a skin on top.” “You put in more than twice enough milk.” Meg peered into the saucepan. Charles Wallace nodded serenely. “I thought Mother might like some.” “I might like what?” a voice said, and there was their mother standing in the doorway. “Cocoa,” Charles Wallace said. “Would you like a liverwurst-and-cream-cheese sandwich? I’ll be happy to make you one.” “That would be lovely,” Mrs. Murry said, “but I can make it myself if you’re busy.” “No trouble at all.” Charles Wallace slid down from his chair and trotted over to the refrigerator, his pajamaed feet padding softly as a kitten’s. “How about you, Meg?” he asked. “Sandwich?” “Yes, please,” she said. “But not liverwurst. Do we have any tomatoes?” Charles Wallace peered into the crisper. “One. All right if I use it on Meg, Mother?” “To what better use could it be put?” Mrs. Murry smiled. “But not so loud, please, Charles. That is, unless you want the twins downstairs, too.” “Let’s be exclusive,” Charles Wallace said. “That’s my new word for the day. Impressive, isn’t it?” “Prodigious,” Mrs. Murry said. “Meg, come let me look at that bruise.” Meg knelt at her mother’s feet. The warmth and light ofthe kitchen had relaxed her so that her attic fears were gone. The cocoa steamed fragrantly in the saucepan; geraniums bloomed on the window sills and there was a bouquet of tiny yellow chrysanthemums in the center of the table. The curtains, red, with a blue and green geometrical pattern, were drawn, and seemed to reflect their cheerfulness throughout the room. The furnace purred like a great, sleepy animal; the lights glowed with steady radiance; outside, alone in the dark, the wind still battered against the house, but the angry power that had frightened Meg while she was alone in the attic was subdued by the familiar comfort of the kitchen. Underneath Mrs. Murry’s chair Fortinbras let out a contented sigh. Mrs. Murry gently touched Meg’s bruised cheek. Meg looked up at her mother, half in loving admiration, half in sullen resentment. It was not an advantage to have a mother who was a scientist and a beauty as well. Mrs. Murry’s flaming red hair, creamy skin, and violet eyes with long dark lashes, seemed even more spectacular in comparison with Meg’s outrageous plainness. Meg’s hair had been passable as long as she wore it tidily in braids. When she went into high school it was cut, and now she and her mother struggled with putting it up, but one side would come out curly and the other straight, so that she looked even plainer than before. “You don’t know the meaning of moderation, do you, my darling?” Mrs. Murry asked. “A happy medium is something I wonder if you’ll ever learn. That’s a nasty bruise the Henderson boy gave you. By the way, shortly after you’d gone to bed his mother called up to complain about how badly you’d hurt him. I told her that since he’s a year older and at least twenty-five pounds heavier than you are, I thought I was the one who ought to be doing the complaining. But she seemed to think it was all your fault.” “I suppose that depends on how you look at it,” Meg said. “Usually no matter what happens people think it’s my fault, even if I have nothing to do with it at all. But I’m sorry I tried to fight him. It’s just been an awful week. And I’m full of bad feeling.” Mrs. Murry stroked Meg’s shaggy head. “Do you know why?” “I hate being an oddball,” Meg said. “It’s hard on Sandy and Dennys, too. I don’t know if they’re really like everybody else, or if they’re just able to pretend they are. I try to pretend, but it isn’t any help.” “You’re much too straightforward to be able to pretend to be what you aren’t,” Mrs. Murry said. “I’m sorry, Meglet. Maybe if Father were here he could help you, but I don’t think I can do anything till you’ve managed to plow through some more time. Then things will be easier for you. But that isn’t much help right now, is it?” “Maybe if I weren’t so repulsive-looking—maybe if I were pretty like you—” “Mother’s not a bit pretty; she’s beautiful,” Charles Wallace announced, slicing liverwurst. “Therefore I bet she was awful at your age.” “How right you are,” Mrs. Murry said. “Just give yourself time, Meg.” “Lettuce on your sandwich, Mother?” Charles Wallace asked. “No, thanks.” He cut the sandwich into sections, put it on a plate, and set it in front of his mother. “Yours’ll be along in just a minute, Meg. I think I’ll talk to Mrs Whatsit about you.” “Who’s Mrs Whatsit?” Meg asked. “I think I want to be exclusive about her for a while,” Charles Wallace said. “Onion salt?” “Yes, please.” “What’s Mrs Whatsit stand for?” Mrs. Murry asked. “That’s her name,” Charles Wallace answered. “You know the old shingled house back in the woods that the kids won’t go near because they say it’s haunted? That’s where they live.” “They?” “Mrs Whatsit and her two friends. I was out with Fortinbras a couple of days ago—you and the twins were at school, Meg. We like to walk in the woods, and suddenly he took off after a squirrel and I took off after him and we ended up by the haunted house, so I met them by accident, as you might say.” “But nobody lives there,” Meg said. “Mrs Whatsit and her friends do. They’re very enjoyable.” “Why didn’t you tell me about it before?” Mrs. Murry asked. “And you know you’re not supposed to go off our property without permission, Charles.” “I know,” Charles said. “That’s one reason I didn’t tell you. I just rushed off after Fortinbras without thinking. And then I decided, well, I’d better save them for an emergency, anyhow.” A fresh gust of wind took the house and shook it, and suddenly the rain began to lash against the windows. “I don’t think I like this wind,” Meg said nervously. “We’ll lose some shingles off the roof, that’s certain,” Mrs. Murry said. “But this house has stood for almost two hundred years and I think it will last a little longer, Meg. There’s been many a high wind up on this hill.” “But this is a hurricane!” Meg wailed. “The radio kept saying it was a hurricane!” “It’s October,” Mrs. Murry told her. “There’ve been storms in October before.” As Charles Wallace gave Meg her sandwich Fortinbras came out from under the table. He gave a long, low growl, and they could see the dark fur slowly rising on his back. Meg felt her own skin prickle. “What’s wrong?” she asked anxiously. Fortinbras stared at the door that opened into Mrs. Murry’s laboratory which was in the old stone dairy right off the kitchen. Beyond the lab a pantry led outdoors, though Mrs. Murry had done her best to train the family to come into the house through the garage door or the front door and not through her lab. But it was the lab door and not the garage door toward which Fortinbras was growling. “You didn’t leave any nasty-smelling chemicals cooking over a Bunsen burner, did you, Mother?” Charles Wallace asked. Mrs. Murray stood up. “No. But I think I’d better go see what’s upsetting Fort, anyhow.” “It’s the tramp, I’m sure it’s the tramp,” Meg said nervously. “What tramp?” Charles Wallace asked. “They were saying at the post office this afternoon that a tramp stole all Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets.” “We’d better sit on the pillow cases, then,” Mrs. Murry said lightly. “I don’t think even a tramp would be out on a night like this, Meg.” “But that’s probably why he is out,” Meg wailed, “trying to find a place not to be out.” “In which case I’ll offer him the barn till morning.” Mrs. Murry went briskly to the door. “I’ll go with you.” Meg’s voice was shrill. “No, Meg, you stay with Charles and eat your sandwich.” “Eat!” Meg exclaimed as Mrs. Murry went out through the lab. “How does she expect me to eat?” “Mother can take care of herself,” Charles said. “Physically, that is.” But he sat in his father’s chair at the table and his legs kicked at the rungs; and Charles Wallace, unlike most small children, had the ability to sit still. After a few moments that seemed like forever to Meg, Mrs. Murry came back in, holding the door open for—was it the tramp? It seemed small for Meg’s idea of a tramp. The age or sex was impossible to tell, for it was completely bundled up in clothes. Several scarves of assorted colors were tied about the head, and a man’s felt hat perched atop. A shocking pink stole was knotted about a rough overcoat, and black rubber boots covered the feet. “Mrs Whatsit,” Charles said suspiciously, “what are you doing here? And at this time of night, too?” “Now don’t you be worried, my honey.” A voice emerged from among turned-up coat collar, stole, scarves, and hat, a voice like an unoiled gate, but somehow not unpleasant. “Mrs—uh—Whatsit—says she lost her way,” Mrs. Murry said. “Would you care for some hot chocolate, Mrs Whatsit?” “Charmed, I’m sure,” Mrs Whatsit answered, taking off the hat and the stole. “It isn’t so much that I lost my way as that I got blown off course. And when I realized that I was at little Charles Wallace’s house I thought I’d just come in and rest a bit before proceeding on my way.” “How did you know this was Charles Wallace’s house?” Meg asked. “By the smell.” Mrs Whatsit untied a blue and green paisley scarf, a red and yellow flowered print, a gold Liberty print, a red and black bandanna. Under all this a sparse quantity of grayish hair was tied in a small but tidy knot on top of her head. Her eyes were bright, her nose a round, soft blob, her mouth puckered like an autumn apple. “My, but it’s lovely and warm in here,” she said. “Do sit down.” Mrs. Murry indicated a chair. “Would you like a sandwich, Mrs Whatsit? I’ve had liverwurst and cream cheese; Charles has had bread and jam; and Meg, lettuce and tomato.” “Now, let me see,” Mrs Whatsit pondered. “I’m passionately fond of Russian caviar.” “You peeked!” Charles cried indignantly. “We’re saving that for Mother’s birthday and you can’t have any!” Mrs Whatsit gave a deep and pathetic sigh. “No,” Charles said. “Now, you mustn’t give in to her, Mother, or I shall be very angry. How about tuna-fish salad?” “All right,” Mrs Whatsit said meekly. “I’ll fix it,” Meg offered, going to the pantry for a can of tuna fish. —For crying out loud, she thought,—this old woman comes barging in on us in the middle of the night and Mother takes it as though there weren’t anything peculiar about it at all. I’ll bet she is the tramp. I’ll bet she did steal those sheets. And she’s certainly no one Charles Wallace ought to be friends with, especially when he won’t even talk to ordinary people. “I’ve only been in the neighborhood a short time,” Mrs Whatsit was saying as Meg switched off the pantry light and came back into the kitchen with the tuna fish, “and I didn’t think I was going to like the neighbors at all until dear little Charles came over with his dog.” “Mrs Whatsit,” Charles Wallace demanded severely, “why did you take Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets?” “Well, I needed them, Charles dear.” “You must return them at once.” “But Charles, dear, I can’t. I’ve used them.” “It was very wrong of you,” Charles Wallace scolded. “If you needed sheets that badly you should have asked me.” Mrs Whatsit shook her head and clucked. “You can’t spare any sheets. Mrs. Buncombe can.” Meg cut up some celery and mixed it in with the tuna. After a moment’s hesitation she opened the refrigerator door and brought out a jar of little sweet pickles.—Though why I’m doing it for her I don’t know, she thought, as she cut them up.—I don’t trust her one bit. “Tell your sister I’m all right,” Mrs Whatsit said to Charles. “Tell her my intentions are good.” “The road to hell is paved with good intentions,” Charles intoned. “My, but isn’t he cunning.” Mrs Whatsit beamed at him fondly. “It’s lucky he has someone to understand him.” “But I’m afraid he doesn’t,” Mrs. Murry said. “None of us is quite up to Charles.” “But at least you aren’t trying to squash him down.” Mrs Whatsit nodded her head vigorously. “You’re letting him be himself.” “Here’s your sandwich,” Meg said, bringing it to Mrs Whatsit. “Do you mind if I take off my boots before I eat?” Mrs Whatsit asked, picking up the sandwich nevertheless. “Listen.” She moved her feet up and down in her boots, and they could hear water squelching. “My toes are ever so damp. The trouble is that these boots are a mite too tight for me, and I never can take them off by myself.” “I’ll help you,” Charles offered. “Not you. You’re not strong enough.” “I’ll help.” Mrs. Murry squatted at Mrs Whatsit’s feet,yanking on one slick boot. When the boot came off it came suddenly. Mrs. Murry sat down with a thump. Mrs Whatsit went tumbling backward with the chair onto the floor, sandwich held high in one old claw. Water poured out of the boot and ran over the floor and the big braided rug. “Oh, dearie me,” Mrs Whatsit said, lying on her back in the overturned chair, her feet in the air, one in a red and white striped sock, the other still booted. Mrs. Murry got to her feet. “Are you all right, Mrs Whatsit?” “If you have some liniment I’ll put it on my dignity,” Mrs Whatsit said, still supine. “I think it’s sprained. A little oil of cloves mixed well with garlic is rather good.” And she took a large bite of sandwich. “Do please get up,” Charles said. “I don’t like to see you lying there that way. You’re carrying things too far.” “Have you ever tried to get to your feet with a sprained dignity?” But Mrs Whatsit scrambled up, righted the chair, and then sat back down on the floor, the booted foot stuck out in front of her, and took another bite. She moved with great agility for such an old woman. At least Meg was reasonably sure that she was an old woman, and a very old woman at that. Mrs Whatsit, her mouth full, ordered Mrs. Murry, “Now pull while I’m already down.” Quite calmly, as though this old woman and her boots were nothing out of the ordinary, Mrs. Murry pulled until the second boot relinquished the foot. This foot was covered with a blue and gray Argyle sock, and Mrs Whatsit satthere, wriggling her toes, contentedly finishing her sandwich before scrambling to her feet. “Ah,” she said, “that’s ever so much better,” and took both boots and shook them out over the sink. “My stomach is full and I’m warm inside and out and it’s time I went home.” “Don’t you think you’d better stay till morning?” Mrs. Murry asked. “Oh, thank you, dearie, but there’s so much to do I just can’t waste time sitting around frivoling.” “It’s much too wild a night to travel in.” “Wild nights are my glory,” Mrs Whatsit said. “I just got caught in a down draft and blown off course.” “Well, at least till your socks are dry—” “Wet socks don’t bother me. I just didn’t like the water squishing around in my boots. Now don’t worry about me, lamb.” (Lamb was not a word one would ordinarily think of calling Mrs. Murry.) “I shall just sit down for a moment and pop on my boots and then I’ll be on my way. Speaking of ways, pet, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.” Mrs. Murry went very white and with one hand reached backward and clutched at a chair for support. Her voice trembled. “What did you say?” Mrs Whatsit tugged at her second boot. “I said,” she grunted, shoving her foot down in, “that there is”—shove—“such a thing”—shove—“as a tesseract.” Her foot went down into the boot, and grabbing shawls, scarves, and hat, she hustled out the door. Mrs. Murry stayed very still, making no move to help the old woman. As the door opened, Fortinbras streaked in, panting, wet and shiny as a seal. He looked at Mrs. Murry and whined. The door slammed. “Mother, what’s the matter!” Meg cried. “What did she say? What is it?” “The tesseract—” Mrs. Murry whispered. “What did she mean? How could she have known?” TWO Mrs Who When Meg woke to the jangling of her alarm clock the wind was still blowing but the sun was shining; the worst of the storm was over. She sat up in bed, shaking her head to clear it. It must have been a dream. She’d been frightened by the storm and worried about the tramp so she’d just dreamed about going down to the kitchen and seeing Mrs Whatsit and having her mother get all frightened and upset by that word—what was it? Tess—tess something. She dressed hurriedly, picked up the kitten still curled up on the bed, and dumped it unceremoniously on the floor. The kitten yawned, stretched, gave a piteous miaow, trotted out of the attic and down the stairs. Meg made her bed and hurried after it. In the kitchen her mother was making French toast and the twins were already at the table. The kitten was lapping milk out of a saucer. “Where’s Charles?” Meg asked. “Still asleep. We had rather an interrupted night, if you remember.” “I hoped it was a dream,” Meg said. Her mother carefully turned over four slices of French toast, then said in a steady voice, “No, Meg. Don’t hope it was a dream. I don’t understand it any more than you do, but one thing I’ve learned is that you don’t have to understand things for them to be. I’m sorry I showed you I was upset. Your father and I used to have a joke about tesseract.” “What is a tesseract?” Meg asked. “It’s a concept.” Mrs. Murry handed the twins the syrup. “I’ll try to explain it to you later. There isn’t time before school.” “I don’t see why you didn’t wake us up,” Dennys said. “It’s a gyp we missed out on all the fun.” “You’ll be a lot more awake in school today than I will.” Meg took her French toast to the table. “Who cares,” Sandy said. “If you’re going to let old tramps come into the house in the middle of the night, Mother, you ought to have Den and me around to protect you.” “After all, Father would expect us to,” Dennys added. “We know you have a great mind and all, Mother,” Sandy said, “but you don’t have much sense. And certainly Meg and Charles don’t.” “I know. We’re morons.” Meg was bitter. “I wish you wouldn’t be such a dope, Meg. Syrup, please.” Sandy reached across the table. “You don’t have to take everything so personally. Use a happy medium, for heaven’s sake. You just goof around in school and look out the window and don’t pay any attention.” “You just make things harder for yourself,” Dennys said. “And Charles Wallace is going to have an awful time next year when he starts school. We know he’s bright, but he’s so funny when he’s around other people, and they’re so used to thinking he’s dumb, I don’t know what’s going to happen to him. Sandy and I’ll sock anybody who picks on him, but that’s about all we can do.” “Let’s not worry about next year till we get through this one,” Mrs. Murry said. “More French toast, boys?” At school Meg was tired and her eyelids sagged and her mind wandered. In social studies she was asked to name the principal imports and exports of Nicaragua, and though she had looked them up dutifully the evening before, now she could remember none of them. The teacher was sarcastic, the rest of the class laughed, and she flung herself down in her seat in a fury. “Who cares about the imports and exports of Nicaragua, anyhow?” she muttered. “If you’re going to be rude, Margaret, you may leave the room,” the teacher said. “Okay, I will.” Meg flounced out. During study hall the principal sent for her. “What seems to be the problem now, Meg?” he asked, pleasantly enough. Meg looked sulkily down at the floor. “Nothing, Mr. Jenkins.” “Miss Porter tells me you were inexcusably rude.” Meg shrugged. “Don’t you realize that you just make everything harder for yourself by your attitude?” the principal asked. “Now, Meg, I’m convinced that you can do the work and keep up with your grade if you will apply yourself, but some of your teachers are not. You’re going to have to do something about yourself. Nobody can do it for you.” Meg was silent. “Well? What about it, Meg?” “I don’t know what to do,” Meg said. “You could do your homework, for one thing. Wouldn’t your mother help you?” “If I asked her to.” “Meg, is something troubling you? Are you unhappy at home?” Mr. Jenkins asked. At last Meg looked at him, pushing at her glasses in a characteristic gesture. “Everything’sfine at home.” “I’m glad to hear it. But I know it must be hard on you to have your father away.” Meg eyed the principal warily, and ran her tongue over the barbed line of her braces. “Have you had any news from him lately?” Meg was sure it was not only imagination that made her feel that behind Mr. Jenkins’ surface concern was a gleam of avid curiosity. Wouldn’t he like to know! she thought. And if I knew anything he’s the last person I’d tell. Well, one of the last. The postmistress must know that it was almost a year now since the last letter, and heaven knows how many people she’d told, or what unkind guesses she’d made about the reason for the long silence. Mr. Jenkins waited for an answer, but Meg only shrugged. “Just what was your father’s line of business?” Mr. Jenkins asked. “Some kind of scientist, wasn’t he?” “He is a physicist.” Meg bared her teeth to reveal the two ferocious lines of braces. “Meg, don’t you think you’d make a better adjustment to life if you faced facts?” “I do face facts,” Meg said. “They’re lots easier to face than people, I can tell you.” “Then why don’t you face facts about your father?” “You leave my father out of it!” Meg shouted. “Stop bellowing,” Mr. Jenkins said sharply. “Do you want the entire school to hear you?” “So what?” Meg demanded. “I’m not ashamed of anything I’m saying. Are you?” Mr. Jenkins sighed. “Do you enjoy being the most belligerent, uncooperative child in school?” Meg ignored this. She leaned over the desk toward the principal. “Mr. Jenkins, you’ve met my mother, haven’t you? You can’t accuse her of not facing facts, can you? She’s a scientist. She has doctors’ degrees in both biology and bacteriology. Her business is facts. When she tells me that my father isn’t coming home, I’ll believe it. As long as she says Father is coming home, then I’ll believe that.” Mr. Jenkins sighed again. “No doubt your mother wants to believe that your father is coming home, Meg. Very well, I can’t do anything else with you. Go on back to study hall. Try to be a little less antagonistic. Maybe your work would improve if your general attitude were more tractable.” When Meg got home from school her mother was in the lab, the twins were at Little League, and Charles Wallace, the kitten, and Fortinbras were waiting for her. Fortinbras jumped up, put his front paws on her shoulders, and gave her a kiss, and the kitten rushed to his empty saucer and mewed loudly. “Come on,” Charles Wallace said. “Let’s go.” “Where?” Meg asked. “I’m hungry, Charles. I don’t want to go anywhere till I’ve had something to eat.” She was still sore from the interview with Mr. Jenkins, and her voice sounded cross. Charles Wallace looked at her thoughtfully as she went to the refrigerator and gave the kitten some milk, then drank a mugful herself. He handed her a paper bag. “Here’s a sandwich and some cookies and an apple. I thought we’d better go see Mrs Whatsit.” “Oh, golly,” Meg said. “Why, Charles?” “You’re still uneasy about her, aren’t you?” Charles asked. “Well, yes.” “Don’t be. She’s all right. I promise you. She’s on our side.” “How do you know?” “Meg,” he said impatiently. “I know.” “But why should we go see her now?” “I want to find out more about that tesseract thing. Didn’t you see how it upset Mother? You know when Mother can’t control the way she feels, when she lets us see she’s upset, then it’s something big.” Meg thought for a moment. “Okay, let’s go. But let’s take Fortinbras with us.” “Well, of course. He needs the exercise.” They set off, Fortinbras rushing ahead, then doubling back to the two children, then leaping off again. The Murrys lived about four miles out of the village. Behind the house was a pine woods and it was through this that Charles Wallace took Meg. “Charles, you know she’s going to get in awful trouble—Mrs Whatsit, I mean—if they find out she’s broken into the haunted house. And taking Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets and everything. They could send her to jail.” “One of the reasons I want to go over this afternoon is to warn them.” “Them?” “I told you she was there with her two friends. I’m not even sure it was Mrs Whatsit herself who took the sheets, though I wouldn’t put it past her.” “But what would she want all those sheets for?” “I intend to ask her,” Charles Wallace said, “and to tell them they’d better be more careful. I don’t really think they’ll let anybody find them, but I just thought we ought to mention the possibility. Sometimes during vacations some of the boys go out there looking for thrills, but I don’t think anybody’s apt to right now, what with basketball and everything.” They walked in silence for a moment through the fragrant woods, the rusty pine needles gentle under their feet. Up above them the wind made music in the branches. Charles Wallace slipped his hand confidingly in Meg’s, and the sweet, little-boy gesture warmed her so that she felt the tense knot inside her begin to loosen. Charles loves me at any rate, she thought. “School awful again today?” he asked after a while. “Yes. I got sent to Mr. Jenkins. He made snide remarks about Father.” Charles Wallace nodded sagely. “I know.” “How do you know?” Charles Wallace shook his head. “I can’t quite explain. You tell me, that’s all.” “But I never say anything. You just seem to know.” “Everything about you tells me,” Charles said. “How about the twins?” Meg asked. “Do you know about them, too?” “I suppose I could if I wanted to. If they needed me. But it’s sort of tiring, so I just concentrate on you and Mother.” “You mean you read our minds?” Charles Wallace looked troubled. “I don’t think it’s that. It’s being able to understand a sort of language, like sometimes if I concentrate very hard I can understand the wind talking with the trees. You tell me, you see, sort of inad—inadvertently. That’s a good word, isn’t it? I got Mother to look it up in the dictionary for me this morning. I really must learn to read, except I’m afraid it will make it awfully hard for me in school next year if I already know things. I think it will be better if people go on thinking I’m not very bright. They won’t hate me quite so much.” Ahead of them Fortinbras started barking loudly, the warning bay that usually told them that a car was coming up the road or that someone was at the door. “Somebody’s here,” Charles Wallace said sharply. “Somebody’s hanging around the house. Come on.” He started to run, his short legs straining. At the edge of the woods Fortinbras stood in front of a boy, barking furiously. As they came panting up the boy said, “For crying out loud, call off your dog.” “Who is he?” Charles Wallace asked Meg. “Calvin O’Keefe. He’s in Regional, but he’s older than I am. He’s a big bug.” “It’s all right, fella. I’m not going to hurt you,” the boy said to Fortinbras. “Sit, Fort,” Charles Wallace commanded, and Fortinbras dropped to his haunches in front of the boy, a low growl still pulsing in his dark throat. “Okay.” Charles Wallace put his hands on his hips. “Now tell us what you’re doing here.” “I might ask the same of you,” the boy said with some indignation. “Aren’t you two of the Murry kids? This isn’t your property, is it?” He started to move, but Fortinbras’s growl grew louder and he stopped. “Tell me about him, Meg,” Charles Wallace demanded. “What would I know about him?” Meg asked. “He’s a couple of grades above me, and he’s on the basketball team.” “Just because I’m tall.” Calvin sounded a little embarrassed. Tall he certainly was, and skinny. His bony wrists stuck out of the sleeves of his blue sweater; his worn corduroy trousers were three inches too short. He had orange hair that needed cutting and the appropriate freckles to go with it. His eyes were an oddly bright blue. “Tell us what you’re doing here,” Charles Wallace said. “What is this? The third degree? Aren’t you the one who’s supposed to be the moron?” Meg flushed with rage, but Charles Wallace answered placidly, “That’s right. If you want me to call my dog off you’d better give.” “Most peculiar moron I’ve ever met,” Calvin said. “I just came to get away from my family.” Charles Wallace nodded. “What kind of family?” “They all have runny noses. I’m third from the top of eleven kids. I’m a sport.” At that Charles Wallace grinned widely. “So ’m I.” “I don’t mean like in baseball,” Calvin said. “Neither do I.” “I mean like in biology,” Calvin said suspiciously. “A change in gene,” Charles Wallace quoted, “resulting in the appearance in the of spring of a character which is not present in the parents but which is potentially transmissible to its of spring.” “What gives around here?” Calvin asked. “I was told you couldn’t talk.” “Thinking I’m a moron gives people something to feel smug about,” Charles Wallace said. “Why should I disillusion them? How old are you, Cal?” “Fourteen.” “What grade?” “Junior. Eleventh. I’m bright. Listen, did anybody ask you to come here this afternoon?” Charles Wallace, holding Fort by the collar, looked at Calvin suspiciously. “What do you mean, asked?” Calvin shrugged. “You still don’t trust me, do you?” “I don’t distrust you,” Charles Wallace said. “Do you want to tell me why you’re here, then?” “Fort and Meg and I decided to go for a walk. We often do in the afternoon.” Calvin dug his hands down in his pockets. “You’re holding out on me.” “So ’re you,” Charles Wallace said. “Okay, old sport,” Calvin said, “I’ll tell you this much. Sometimes I get a feeling about things. You might call it a compulsion. Do you know what compulsion means?” “Constraint. Obligation. Because one is compelled. Not a very good definition, but it’s the Concise Oxford.” “Okay, okay,” Calvin sighed. “I must remember I’m preconditioned in my concept of your mentality.” Meg sat down on the coarse grass at the edge of the woods. Fort gently twisted his collar out of Charles Wallace’s hands and came over to Meg, lying down beside her and putting his head in her lap. Calvin tried now politely to direct his words toward Meg as well as Charles Wallace, “When I get this feeling, this compulsion, I always do what it tells me. I can’t explain where it comes from or how I get it, and it doesn’t happen very often. But I obey it. And this afternoon I had a feeling that I must come over to the haunted house. That’s all I know, kid. I’m not holding anything back. Maybe it’s because I’m supposed to meet you. You tell me.” Charles Wallace looked at Calvin probingly for a moment; then an almost glazed look came into his eyes, and he seemed to be thinking at him. Calvin stood very still, and waited. At last Charles Wallace said. “Okay. I believe you. But I can’t tell you. I think I’d like to trust you. Maybe you’d better come home with us and have dinner.” “Well, sure, but—what would your mother say to that?” Calvin asked. “She’d be delighted. Mother’s all right. She’s not one of us. But she’s all right.” “What about Meg?” “Meg has it tough,” Charles Wallace said. “She’s not really one thing or the other.” “What do you mean, one of us?” Meg demanded. “What do you mean I’m not one thing or the other?” “Not now, Meg,” Charles Wallace said. “Slowly. I’ll tell you about it later.” He looked at Calvin, then seemed to make a quick decision. “Okay, let’s take him to meet Mrs Whatsit. If he’s not okay she’ll know.” He started off on his short legs toward the dilapidated old house. The haunted house was half in the shadows of the clump of elms in which it stood. The elms were almost bare, now, and the ground around the house was yellow with damp leaves. The late afternoon light had a greenish cast which the blank windows reflected in a sinister way. An unhinged shutter thumped. Something else creaked. Meg did not wonder that the house had a reputation for being haunted. A board was nailed across the front door, but Charles Wallace led the way around to the back. The door there appeared to be nailed shut, too, but Charles Wallace knocked, and the door swung slowly outward, creaking on rusty hinges. Up in one of the elms an old black crow gave its raucous cry, and a woodpecker went into a wild rat-a-tat-tat. A large gray rat scuttled around the corner of the house and Meg let out a stifled shriek. “They get a lot of fun out of using all the typical props,” Charles Wallace said in a reassuring voice. “Come on. Follow me.” Calvin put a strong hand to Meg’s elbow, and Fort pressed against her leg. Happiness at their concern was so strong in her that her panic fled, and she followed Charles Wallace into the dark recesses of the house without fear. They entered into a sort of kitchen. There was a huge fireplace with a big black pot hanging over a merry fire. Why had there been no smoke visible from the chimney? Something in the pot was bubbling, and it smelled more like one of Mrs. Murry’s chemical messes than something to eat. In a dilapidated Boston rocker sat a plump little woman. She wasn’t Mrs Whatsit, so she must, Meg decided, be one of Mrs Whatsit’s two friends. She wore enormous spectacles, twice as thick and twice as large as Meg’s, and she was sewing busily, with rapid jabbing stitches, on a sheet. Several other sheets lay on the dusty floor. Charles Wallace went up to her. “I really don’t think you ought to have taken Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets without consulting me,” he said, as cross and bossy as only a very small boy can be. “What on earth do you want them for?” The plump little woman beamed at him. “Why, Charlsie, my pet!Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point. French. Pascal. The heart has its reasons, whereof reason knows nothing.” “But that’s not appropriate at all,” Charles said crossly. “Your mother would find it so.” A smile seemed to gleam through the roundness of spectacles. “I’m not talking about my mother’s feelings about my father,” Charles Wallace scolded. “I’m talking about Mrs. Buncombe’s sheets.” The little woman sighed. The enormous glasses caught the light again and shone like an owl’s eyes. “In case we need ghosts, of course,” she said. “I should think you’d have guessed. If we have to frighten anybody away Whatsit thought we ought to do it appropriately. That’s why it’s so much fun to stay in a haunted house. But we really didn’t mean you to know about the sheets. Auf frischer Tat ertappt. German. In flagrante delicto. Latin. Caught in the act. English. As I was saying—” But Charles Wallace held up his hand in a peremptory gesture. “Mrs Who, do you know this boy?” Calvin bowed. “Good afternoon, Ma’am. I didn’t quite catch your name.” “Mrs Who will do,” the woman said. “He wasn’t my idea, Charlsie, but I think he’s a good one.” “Where’s Mrs Whatsit?” Charles asked. “She’s busy. It’s getting near time, Charlsie, getting near time. Ab honesto virum bonum nihil deterret. Seneca. Nothing deters a good man from doing what is honorable. And he’s a very good man, Charlsie, darling, but right now he needs our help.” “Who?” Meg demanded. “And little Megsie! Lovely to meet you, sweetheart. Your father, of course. Now go home, loves. The time is not yet ripe. Don’t worry, we won’t go without you. Get plenty of food and rest. Feed Calvin up. Now, off with you! Justitiae soror fides. Latin again, of course. Faith is the sister of justice. Trust in us! Now, shoo!” And she fluttered up from her chair and pushed them out the door with surprising power. “Charles,” Meg said. “I don’t understand.” Charles took her by the hand and dragged her away from the house. Fortinbras ran on ahead, and Calvin was close behind them. “No,” he said, “I don’t either, yet. Not quite. I’ll tell you what I know as soon as I can. But you saw Fort, didn’t you? Not a growl. Not a quiver. Just as though there weren’t anything strange about it. So you know it’s okay. Look, do me a favor, both of you. Let’s not talk about it till we’ve had something to eat. I need fuel so I can sort things out and assimilate them properly.” “Lead on, moron,” Calvin cried gaily. “I’ve never even seen your house, and I have the funniest feeling that for the first time in my life I’m going home!” THREE Mrs Which In the forest evening was already beginning to fall, and they walked in silence. Charles and Fortinbras gamboled on ahead. Calvin walked with Meg, his fingers barely touching her arm in a protective gesture. This has been the most impossible, the most confusing afternoon of my life, she thought, yet I don’t feel confused or upset anymore; I only feel happy. Why? “Maybe we weren’t meant to meet before this,” Calvin said. “I mean, I knew who you were in school and everything, but I didn’t know you. But I’m glad we’ve met now, Meg. We’re going to be friends, you know.” “I’m glad, too,” Meg whispered, and they were silent again. When they got back to the house Mrs. Murry was still in the lab. She was watching a pale blue fluid move slowly through a tube from a beaker to a retort. Over a Bunsen burner bubbled a big, earthenware dish of stew. “Don’t tell Sandy and Dennys I’m cooking out here,” she said. “They’re always suspicious that a few chemicals may get in with the meat, but I had an experiment I wanted to stay with.” “This is Calvin O’Keefe, Mother,” Meg said. “Is there enough for him, too? It smells super.” “Hello, Calvin.” Mrs. Murry shook hands with him.“Nice to meet you. We aren’t having anything but stew tonight, but it’s a good thick one.” “Sounds wonderful to me,” Calvin said. “May I use your phone so my mother’ll know where I am?” “Of course. Show him where it is, will you, please, Meg? I won’t ask you to use the one out here, if you don’t mind. I’d like to finish up this experiment.” Meg led the way into the house. Charles Wallace and Fortinbras had gone off. Outdoors she could hear Sandy and Dennys hammering at the fort they were building up in one of the maples. “This way.” Meg went through the kitchen and into the living room. “I don’t know why I call her when I don’t come home,” Calvin said, his voice bitter. “She wouldn’t notice.” He sighed and dialed. “Ma?” he said. “Oh, Hinky. Tell Ma I won’t be home till late. Now don’t forget. I don’t want to be locked out again.” He hung up, looked at Meg. “Do you know how lucky you are?” She smiled rather wryly. “Not most of the time.” “A mother like that! A house like this! Gee, your mother’s gorgeous! You should see my mother. She had all her upper teeth out and Pop got her a plate but she won’t wear it, and most days she doesn’t even comb her hair. Not that it makes much difference when she does.” He clenched his fists. “But I love her. That’s the funny part of it. I love them all, and they don’t give a hoot about me. Maybe that’s why I call when I’m not going to be home. Because I care. Nobody else does. You don’t know how lucky you are to be loved.” Meg said in a startled way, “I guess I never thought of that. I guess I just took it for granted.” Calvin looked somber; then his enormous smile lit up his face again. “Things are going to happen, Meg! Good things! I feel it!” He began wandering, still slowly, around the pleasant, if shabby, living room. He stopped before a picture on the piano of a small group of men standing together on a beach. “Who’s this?” “Oh, a bunch of scientists.” “Where?” Meg went over to the picture. “Cape Canaveral. This one’s Father.” “Which?” “Here.” “The one with glasses?” “Yup. The one who needs a haircut.” Meg giggled, forgetting her worries in her pleasure at showing Calvin the picture. “His hair’s sort of the same color as mine, and he keeps forgetting to have it cut. Mother usually ends up doing it for him—she bought clippers and stuff—because he won’t take the time to go to the barber.” Calvin studied the picture. “I like him,” he announced judiciously. “Looks kind of like Charles Wallace, doesn’t he?” Meg laughed again. “When Charles was a baby he looked exactly like Father. It was really funny.” Calvin continued to look at the picture. “He’s not handsome or anything. But I like him.” Meg was indignant. “He is too handsome.” Calvin shook his head. “Nah. He’s tall and skinny like me.” “Well, I think you’re handsome,” Meg said. “Father’s eyes are kind of like yours, too. You know. Really blue. Only you don’t notice his as much because of the glasses.” “Where is he now?” Meg stiffened. But she didn’t have to answer because the door from lab to kitchen slammed, and Mrs. Murry came in, carrying a dish of stew. “Now,” she called, “I’ll finish this up properly on the stove. Have you done your homework, Meg?” “Not quite,” Meg said, going back into the kitchen. “Then I’m sure Calvin won’t mind if you finish before dinner.” “Sure, go ahead.” Calvin fished in his pocket and pulled out a wad of folded paper. “As a matter of fact I have some junk of mine to finish up. Math. That’s one thing I have a hard time keeping up in. I’m okay on anything to do with words, but I don’t do as well with numbers.” Mrs. Murry smiled. “Why don’t you get Meg to help you?” “But, see, I’m several grades above Meg.” “Try asking her to help you with your math, anyhow,” Mrs. Murry suggested. “Well, sure,” Calvin said. “Here. But it’s pretty complicated.” Meg smoothed out the paper and studied it. “Do they care how you do it?” she asked. “I mean, can you work it out your own way?” “Well, sure, as long as I understand and get the answers right.” “Well, we have to do it their way. Now look, Calvin, don’t you see how much easier it would be if you did it this way?” Her pencil flew over the paper. “Hey!” Calvin said. “Hey! I think I get it. Show me once more on another one.” Again Meg’s pencil was busy. “All you have to remember is that every ordinary fraction can be converted into an infinite periodic decimal fraction. See? So 3/7 is 0.428571.” “This is the craziest family.” Calvin grinned at her. “I suppose I should stop being surprised by now, but you’re supposed to be dumb in school, always being called up on the carpet.” “Oh, I am.”"
66,The Dark Is Rising,"Cooper, Susan",b075_TheDarkIsRising.txt,4,"He was woken by music. It beckoned him, lilting and insistent; delicate music, played by delicate instruments that he could not identify, with one rippling, bell-like phrase running through it in a gold thread of delight. There was in this music so much of the deepest enchantment of all his dreams and imaginings that he woke smiling in pure happiness at the sound. In the moment of his waking, it began to fade, beckoning as it went, and then as he opened his eyes it was gone. He had only the memory of that one rippling phrase still echoing in his head, and itself fading so fast that he sat up abruptly in bed and reached his arm out to the air, as if he could bring it back. The room was very still, and there was no music, and yet Will knew that it had not been a dream. He was in the twins’ room still; he could hear Robin’s breathing, slow and deep, from the other bed. Cold light glimmered round the edge of the curtains, but no one was stirring anywhere; it was very early. Will pulled on his rumpled clothes from the day before, and slipped out of the room. He crossed the landing to the central window, and looked down. In the first shining moment he saw the whole strange-familial world, glistening white; the roofs of the outbuildings mounded into square towers of snow, and beyond them all the fields and hedge: buried, merged into one great flat expanse, unbroken white to the horizon’s brim. Will drew in a long, happy breath, silently rejoicing. Then, very faintly, he heard the music again, the same phrase. He swung round vainly searching for it in the air, as if he might see it somewhere like a flickering light. “Where are you?”"
67,Dragonwings,"Yep, Laurence",b076_Dragonwings.txt,4,"By the time the winter rains came to the city, we were not becoming rich, but we were doing well. Each day we put a little money away in our cold tin can. Father never said anything, but I knew he was thinking about the day when we might be able to afford to bring Mother over. You see, it was not simply a matter of paying her passage over on the boat. Father would probably have to go over after her and escort her across. There had to be money for bribes—tea money, Uncle called it—at both ends of the ocean. Now that we no longer belonged to the Company, we somehow had to acquire a thousand dollars worth of property, a faraway figure when you can only save nickels and dimes. And yet the hope that we could start our own little fix-it shop and qualify as merchants steadily grew with the collection of coins in the tin can. I was happy most of the time, even when it became the time for the New Year by the Tang people’s reckoning. […] We took the old picture of the Stove King and smeared some honey on it before we burned it in the stove. Later that evening we would hang up a new picture of the Stove King that we had bought in the Tang people’s town. That was a sign the Stove King had returned to his place above our stove. After we had finished burning the old picture, we sat down to a lunch of meat pastries and dumplings."
68,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","Taylor, Mildred D",b077_RollofThunderHearMyCry.txt,4,"'Little Man, would you come on! You keep it up and you're gonna make us late.' My youngest brother paid no attention to me. Grasping more firmly his newspaper-wrapped notebook and his tin can lunch of cornbread and oil sausages, he continued to concentrate on the dusty road. He lagged several feet behind my other brothers, Stacey and Christopher-John, and me, attempting to keep the rusty Mississippi dust from swelling with each step and drifting back upon his shiny black shoes and the cuffs of his corduroy pants by lifting each foot high before setting it gently down again. Always meticulously neat, six-year old Little Man never allowed dirt or tears or stains to mar anything he owned. Today was no exception. 'You keep it up and make us late for school, Mama's gonna wear you out.' I threatened, pulling with exasperation at the high collar of the Sunday dress Mama had made me wear for the first day of school - as if that event were something special. it seemed to me that showing up at school at all on a bright August-like October morning made for running the cool forest trails and wading barefoot in the forest pond was concession enough; Sunday clothing was asking too much. Christopher-John and Stacey were not too pleased about the clothing or school either. Only Little Man, just beginning his school career, found the prospects of both intriguing. 'Y'all go ahead and get dirty if y'all wanna,' he replied without even looking up from his studied steps, 'Me, I'm gonna stay clean.' ‘I betcha Mama's gonna ""clean"" you, you keep it up.' I grumbled. ‘Ah, Cassie, leave him be,' Stacey admonished, frowning and kicking testily at the road. ‘I ain't said nothing but..’ Stacey cut me a wicked look and I grew silent. His disposition had been irritatingly sour lately. If I hadn't known the cause of it. I could have forgotten very easily that he was at twelve, bigger than I, and that I had promised Mama to arrive at school looking clean and ladylike. 'Shoot,' I mumbled finally, unable to restrain myself from further comment, 'it ain't my fault you gotta be in Mama's class this year.' Stacey's frown deepened and he jammed his fists into his pockets, but said nothing. Christopher-John, walking between Stacey and me, glanced uneasily at both of us but did not interfere. A short, round boy of seven, he took little interest in troublesome things, preferring to remain on good terms with everyone, Yet he was always sensitive to others and now, shifting the handle of his lunch can from his right hand to his right wrist and his smudged notebook from his left hand to his left armpit. he stuffed his free hands into his pockets and attempted to make his face as moody as Stacey's and as cranky as mine. But after a few moments he seemed to forget that he was supposed to be grouchy and began whistling cheerfully. There was little that could make Christopher-John unhappy for very long, not even the thought of school. I tugged again at my collar and dragged my feet in the dust, allowing it to sift back onto my socks and shoes like gritty red snow. I hated the dress. And the shoes. There was little I could do in a dress, and as for shoes, they imprisoned freedomloving feet accustomed to the feel of the warm earth, ‘Cassie, stop that,' Stacey snapped as the dust billowed in swirling clouds around my feet. I looked up sharply, ready to protest. Christopher-John's whistling increased to a raucous, nervous shrill. and grudgingly T let the matter drop and trudged along in moody silence, my brothers growing as pensively quiet as I. Before us the narrow, sun-splotched road wound like a lazy red serpent dividing the high forest bank of quiet, old trees on the left from the cotton field, forested by giant green-and-purple stalks. on the right. A barbed-wire fence ran the length of the deep field, stretching eastward for over a quarter of a mile until it met the sloping green pasture that signaled the end of our family's four hundred acres, An ancient oak tree on the slope, visible even now, was the official dividing mark between Logan land and the beginning of a dense forest. Beyond the protective fencing of the forest, vast farming fields, worked by a multitude of share- cropping families, covered two-thirds of a ten-square-mile plantation. That was Harlan Granger land. Once our land had been Granger land too, but the Grangers had sold it during Reconstruction to a Yankee for tax money. In 1887, when the land was up for sell again, Grandpa had bought two hundred acres of it, and in 19I8, after the first two hundred acres had been paid off, he had bought another two hundred, It was good rich land, much of it still virgin forest, and there was no debt on half of it. But there was a mortgage on the two hundred acres bought in 1918 and there were taxes on the full four hundred, and for the past three years there had not been enough money from the cotton to pay both and live on too. That was why Papa had gone to work on the railroad. In 1930 the price of cotton dropped, And so, in the spring of 1931, Papa set out looking for work, going as far north as Memphis and as far south as the Delta country, He had gone west too, into Louisiana. It was there he found work laying track for the railroad. He worked the remainder of the year away from us, not returning until the deep winter when the ground was cold and barren. The following spring after the planting was finished. he did the same. Now it was 1933 and Papa was again in Louisiana laying track, I asked him once why he had to go away, why the land was so important. He took my hand and said in his quiet way: 'Look out there, Cassie girl. All that belongs to you. You ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as I live and the family survives, you'll never have to. That's important. You may not understand that now, but one day you will. Then you'll see. I looked at Papa strangely when he said that, for I knew that all the land did not belong to me. Some of it belonged to Stacey, Christopher-John, and Little Man, not to mention the part that belonged to Big Ma. Mama, and Uncle Hammer, Papa's older brother who lived in Chicago. But Papa never divided the land in his mind: it was simply Logan land. For it he would work the long, hot summer pounding steel: Mama would teach and run the farm; Big Ma, in her sixties, would work like a woman of twenty in the fields and keep the house; and the boys and I would wear threadbare clothing washed to dishwater color: but always, the taxes and the mortgage would be paid. Papa said that one day I would understand. I wondered. When the fields ended and the Granger forest fanned both sides of the road with long overhanging branches, a tall, emaciated-looking boy popped suddenly from a forest trail and swung a thin arm around Stacey. It was T. J. Avery. His younger brother Claude emerged a moment later, smiling weakly as if it pained him to do so. Neither boy had on shoes, and their Sunday clothing, patched and worn, hung loosely upon their frail frames. The Avery family share- cropped on Granger land. 'Well.' said T.J.. jauntily swinging into step with Stacey, there we go again startin' another school year. 'Yeah,' sighed Stacey, 'Ah, man, don't look so down,' T.J. said cheerfully. 'Your mama's really one great teacher. I should know.' He certainly should. He had failed Mama's class last year and was now returning for a second try, 'Shoot! You can say that,' exclaimed Stacey. 'You don't have to spend all day in a classroom with your mama.' 'Look on the bright side,' said T.J. 'Jus' think of the advantage you've got. You'll be learnin' all sorts of stuff 'fore the rest of us...' He smiled slyly. 'like what's on all them tests. Stacey thrust T.J.'s arm from his shoulders. 'If that's what you think, you don't know Mama.' 'Ain't no need gettin' mad,' T.J. replied undaunted. 'Jus' an idea.' He was quiet for a moment, then announced, 'I betcha I could give y'all an earful 'bout that burnin' last night.' 'Burning I What burning?' asked Stacey. 'Man, don't y'all know nothin'! The Berrys' burnin'. I thought y'all's grandmother went over there last night to see 'bout 'em.' Of course we knew that Big Ma had gone to a sick house last night. She was good at medicines and people often called her instead of a doctor when they were sick. But we didn't know anything about any burnings, and I certainly didn't know anything about any Berrys either. 'What Berrys he talking 'bout, Stacey!' I asked. 'I don't know no Berrys. 'They live way over on the other side of Smellings Creek. They come up to church sometimes,' said Stacey absently. Then he turned back to T.J. 'Mr. Lanier come by real late and got Big Ma. Said Mr.. Berry was low sick and needed her to help nurse him, but he ain't said nothing 'bout no burning.' 'He's low sick all right ~'cause he got burnt near to death. Him and his two nephews, And you know who done 'Who!' Stacey and I asked together. 'Well, since y'all don't seem to know nothin',' said T.J., in his usual sickening way of nursing a tidbit of information to death, 'maybe I ought not tell y'all, It might hurt y'all's little ears.' 'Ah, boy,' I said, 'don't start that mess again.' I didn't like T.J. very much and his stalling around didn't help. 'Come on, T.J.,' said Stacey, 'out with it.' 'Well ...' T.J. murmured, then grew silent as if considering whether or not he should talk, We reached the first of two crossroads and turned north; another mile and we would approach the second crossroads and turn east again. Finally T.J. said, 'Okay. See, them Berrys' burnin' wasn't no accident. Some white men took a match to 'em,' 'Y-you mean just lit 'em up like a piece of wood!' stammered Christopher-John, his eyes growing big with disbelief. 'But why!' asked Stacey, T.J. shrugged. 'Don't know why. Jus' know they done it, that's all.' 'How you know !' I questioned suspiciously. He smiled smugly. ''Cause your mama come down on her way to school and talked to my mama 'bout it.' 'She did !' 'Yeah, and you should've seen the way she look when she come outa that house.' 'How'd she look!' inquired Little Man, interested enough to glance up from the road for the first time. T.J. looked around grimly and whispered. 'like... death.' He waited a moment for his words to be appropriately shocking, but the effect was spoiled by Little Man, who asked lightly, 'What does death look like !' T.J. turned in annoyance. 'Don't he know nothin'!' 'Well, what does it look like?' Little Man demanded to know. He didn't like T.J. either, 'Like my grandfather looked jus' 'fore they buried him, T.J. described all-knowingly. 'Oh.' replied Little Man, losing interest and concentrating on the road again. 'I tell ya. Stacey, man,' said T.J. morosely, shaking his head. 'sometimes I jus' don't know 'bout that family of yours. Stacey pulled back, considering whether or not T.J.'s words were offensive. but T.]. immediately erased the question by continuing amiably. 'Don't get me wrong, Stacey. They some real swell kids, but that Cassie 'bout got me whipped this mornin'. 'Good !' I said. 'Now how'd she do that !' Stacey laughed. 'You wouldn't be laughin' if it'd've happened to you. She up and told your mama 'bout me goin' up to that Wallace store dancin' room and Miz Logan told Mama.' He eyed me disdainfully then went on. 'But don't worry, I got out of it though. When Mama asked me 'bout it, I jus' said ole Claude was always sneakin' up there to get some of that free candy Mr. Kaleb give out sometimes and I had to go and get him 'cause I knowed good and well she didn't want us up there. Boy, did he get it?' T.J. laughed. 'Mama 'bout wore him out. I stared at quiet Claude. 'You let him do that!' I exclaimed. But Claude only smiled in that sickly way of his and I knew that he had. He was more afraid of T.J. than of his mother. Again Little Man glanced up and I could see his dislike for T.J. growing. Friendly Christopher-John glared at T.J., and putting his short arm around Claude's shoulder said. 'Come on, Claude. let's go on ahead.' Then he and Claude hurried up the road, away from T.J. Stacey, who generally overlooked T.J.'s underhanded stunts, shook his head. 'That was dirty. 'Well, what'd ya expect me to do! I couldn't let her think I was g-oin' up there 'cause I like to, could I! She' d've killed me!' 'And good riddance.' I thought, promising myself that if he ever pulled anything like that on me, I'd knock his block off. We were nearing the second crossroads, where deep gullies lined both sides of the road and the dense forest crept to the very edges of high. jagged, clay-walled banks. Suddenly, Stacey turned, 'Quick!' he cried. 'Off the road!' Without another word, all of us but Little Man scrambled up the steep right bank into the forest. 'Get up here, Man.' Stacey ordered, but Little Man only gazed at the ragged red bank sparsely covered with scraggly brown briars and kept on walking .'Come on, do like I say. 'But I'll get my clothes dirty i' protested Little Man. 'You're gonna get them a whole lot dirtier you stay down there. Look!' Little Man turned around and watched saucer-eyed as a bus bore down on him spewing clouds of red dust like a huge yellow dragon breathing fire. Little Man headed toward the bank, but it was too steep. He ran frantically along the road looking for a foothold and, finding one, hopped onto the bank, but not before the bus had sped past enveloping him in a scarlet haze while laughing white faces pressed against the bus windows. Little Man shook a threatening fist into the thick air, then looked dismally down at himself. 'Well, ole Little Man done got his Sunday clothes dirty, T.J. laughed as we jumped down from the bank. Angry tears welled in Little Man's eyes but he quickly brushed them away before T.J. could see them. 'Ah, shut up, T.J.,' Stacey snapped, 'Yeah, shut up. T.J.,' I echoed. 'Come on, Man,' Stacey said,' and next time do like I tell ya.' Little Man hopped down from the bank. 'How's come they did that. Stacey, huh!' he asked. dusting himself off. 'How's come they didn't even stop for us !' ''Cause they like to see us run and it ain't our bus.' Stacey said, balling his fists and jamming them tightly into his pockets. 'Well, where's our bus !' demanded Little Man. 'We ain't got one.' 'Well, why not!' 'Ask Mama,' Stacey replied as a towheaded boy, bare- footed and pale. came running down a forest path toward us. The boy quickly caught up and fell in stride with Stacey and T.J. 'Hey, Stacey,' he said shyly. 'Hey, Jeremy,' Stacey said. There was an awkward silence. 'Y'all jus' startin' school today !' 'Yeah.' replied Stacey, 'I wishin' ours was jus' startin',' sighed Jeremy. 'Ours been goin' since the end of August.' Jeremy's eyes were a whitewashed blue and they seemed to weep when he spoke. 'Yeah,' said Stacey again. Jeremy kicked the dust briskly and looked toward the north. He was a strange boy. Ever since I had begun school, he had walked with us as far as the crossroads in the morning. and met us there in the afternoon. He was often ridiculed by the other children at his school and had shown up more than once with wide red welts on his arms which Lillian Jean, his older sister, had revealed with satisfaction were the result of his associating with us. Still, Jeremy continued to meet us. When we reached the crossroads, three more children, a girl of twelve or thirteen and two boys, all looking very much like Jeremy, rushed past, The girl was Lillian Jean, 'Jeremy, come on.' she said without a backward glance, and Jeremy, smiling sheepishly, waved a timid good-bye and slowly followed her. We stood in the crossing gazing after them. Jeremy looked back once but then Lillian Jean yelled shrilly at him and he did not look back again. They were headed for the Jefferson Davis County School. a long white wooden building looming in the distance. Behind the building was a wide sports field around which were scattered rows of tiered gray-looking benches. In front of it were two yellow buses, our own tormentor and one that brought students from the other direction, and loitering students awaiting the knell of the morning bell. In the very center of the expansive front lawn, waving red, white and blue with the emblem of the Confederacy emblazoned in its upper left-hand corner. was the Mississippi nag. Directly below it was the American flag. As Jeremy and his sister and brothers hurried reward those transposed flags, we turned eastward toward our own school. The Great Faith Elementary and Secondary School, one of the largest black schools in the county, was a dismal end to an hour's journey. Consisting of four weather-beaten wooden houses on stilts of brick. 320 students, seven teachers. a principal. a caretaker, and the caretaker's cow, which kept the wide crabgrass lawn sufficiently clipped in spring and summer, the school was located near three plantations, the largest and closest by far being the Granger plantation. Most of the students were from families that sharecropped on Granger land, and the others mainly from Montier and Harrison plantation families. Because the students were needed in the fields from early spring when the cotton was planted until after most of the cotton had been picked in the fall, the school adjusted its terms accordingly, beginning in October and dismissing in March. But even so, after today a number of the older students would not be seen again for a month or two, not until the last puff of cotton had been gleaned from the fields, and eventually most would drop out of school altogether. Because of this the classes in the higher grades grew Smaller with each passing year. The class buildings, with their backs practically against the forest wall, formed a semicircle facing a small one-room church at the opposite edge of the compound. It was to this church that many of the school's students and their parents belonged. As we arrived, the enormous iron bell in the church belfry was ringing vigorously, warning the milling students that only five minutes of freedom remained. Little Man immediately pushed his way across the lawn to the well. Stacey and T.J., ignoring the rest of us now that they were on the school grounds, wandered off to be with the other seventh-grade boys, and Christopher-John and Claude rushed to reunite with their classmates of last year. Left alone, I dragged slowly to the building that held the first four grades and sat on the bottom step. Plopping my pencils and notebook into the dirt, I propped my elbows on my knees and rested my chin in the palms of my hands. 'Hey, Cassie,' said Mary Lou Wellever, the principal's daughter, as she flounced by in a new yellow dress. 'Hey, yourself,' I said, scowling so ferociously that she kept on walking. I stared after her a moment noting that she would have on a new dress. Certainly no one else did. Patches on faded pants and dresses abounded on boys and girls come so recently from the heat of the cotton fields. Girls stood awkwardly, afraid to sit, and boys pulled restlessly at starched, highbuttoned collars. Those students fortunate enough to have shoes hopped from one pinched foot to the other. Tonight the Sunday clothes would be wrapped in newspaper and hung for Sunday and the shoes would be packed away to be brought out again only when the weather turned so cold that bare feet could no longer traverse the frozen roads: but for today we all suffered. On the far side of the lawn I spied Moe Turner speeding toward the seventh-grade-class building, and wondered at his energy. Moe was one of Stacey's friends. He lived on the Montier plantation, a three-and-a-half-hour walk from the school. Because of the distance. many children from the Montier plantation did not come to Great Faith after they had finished the four-year school near Smellings Creek. But there were some girls and boys like Moe who made the trek daily, leaving their homes while the sky was black and not returning until all was blackness again. I for one was certainly glad that I didn't live that far away. I don't think my feet would have wanted that badly for me to be educated. The chiming of the second bell began. I stood up dusting my bottom as the first, second, third, and fourth graders crowded up the stairs into the hallway. Little Man flashed proudly past, his face and hands clean and his black shoes shining again. I glanced down at my own shoes powdered red and, raising my right foot, rubbed it against the back of my left leg, then reversed the procedure. As the last gong of the bell reverberated across the compound, I swooped up my pencils and notebook and ran inside. A hallway extended from the front to the back door of the building. On either side of the hallway were two door- ways. both leading into the same large room which was divided into two classrooms by a heavy canvas curtain. The second and third grades were on the left, the first and fourth grades on the right. I hurried to the rear of the building, turned to the right, and slid into a third-row bench occupied by Gracey Pearson and Alma Scott. 'You can't sit here.' objected Gracey. 'I'm saving it for Mary Lou. I glanced back at Mary Lou Wellever, depositing her lunch pail on a shelf in the back of the room and said, 'Not any more you ain't,' Miss Daisy Crocker, yellow and buckeyed, glared down at me from the middle of the room with a look that said, 'Soooooooo, it's you, Cassie Logan.' Then she pursed her lips and drew the curtain along the rusted iron rod and tucked it into a wide loop in the back wall. With the curtain drawn back, the first graders gazed quizzically at us. Little Man sat by a window, his hands folded, patiently waiting for Miss Crocker to speak. Mary Lou nudged me. 'That's my seat, Cassie Logan. 'Mary Lou Wellever,' Miss Crocker called primly, 'have a seat.' 'Yes, ma'am,' said Mary Lou, eyeing me with a look of pure hate before turning away. Miss Crocker walked stiffly to her desk, which was set on a tiny platform and piled high with bulky objects covered by a tarpaulin, She rapped the desk with a ruler, although the room was perfectly still, and said, 'Welcome, children, to Great Faith Elementary School.' Turning slightly so that she stared squarely at the left side of the room, she continued, 'To all of you fourth graders, it's good to have you in my class. I'll be expecting many good and wonderful things from you.' Then addressing the right side of the room, she said, ‘And to all our little first grade friends only today starting on the road to knowledge and education, may your tiny feet find the pathways of learning steady and forever before you.' Already bored, I stretched my right arm on the desk and rested my head in my upraised hand. Miss Crocker smiled mechanically, then rapped on her desk again. 'Now, little ones,' she said, still talking to the first grade, 'your teacher, Miss Davis, has been held up in Jackson for a few days so I'll have the pleasure of sprinkling your little minds with the first rays of knowledge.' She beamed down upon them as if she expected to be applauded for this bit of news, then with a swoop of her large eyes to include the fourth graders, she went on. 'Now since there's only one of me, we shall have to sacrifice for the next few days. We shall work, work, work. but we shall have to work like little Christian boys and girls and share, share, share. Now are we willing to do that!' 'YES'M. MIZ CROCKER,' the children chorused. But I remained silent. I never did approve of group responses. Adjusting my head in my hand, I sighed heavily, my mind on the burning of the Berrys. 'Cassie Logan!' I looked up, startled. 'Cassie Logan!' 'Yes, ma'am!' I jumped up quickly to face Miss Crocker. 'Aren't you willing to work and share !' 'Yes'm.’ ‘Then say so!' 'Yes'm,' I murmured, sliding back into my seat as Mary Lou. Gracey, and Alma giggled. Here it was only five minutes into the new school year and already I was in trouble. By ten o'clock, Miss Crocker had rearranged our seating and written our names on her seating chart. I was still sitting beside Gracey and Alma but we had been moved from the third to the first row in front of a small potbellied stove. Although being eyeball to eyeball with Miss Crocker was nothing to look forward to, the prospect of being warm once the cold weather set in was nothing to be sneezed at either, so I resolved to make the best of my rather dubious position. Now Miss Crocker made a startling announcement: 'This year we would all have books. Everyone gasped, for most of the students had never handled a book at all besides the family Bible. I admit that even I was somewhat excited. Although Mama had several books. I had never had one of my very own. 'Now we're very fortunate to get these readers,' Miss Crocker explained while we eagerly awaited the unveiling. The county superintendent of schools himself brought these books down here for our use and we must take extra-good care of them.' She moved toward her desk. 'So let's all promise that we'll take the best care possible of these new books.' She stared down, expecting our response. 'All right, all together, let's repeat, ""We promise to take good care of our new books.""' She looked sharply at me as she spoke. 'WE PROMISE TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR NEW BOOKS!' 'Fine,' Miss Crocker beamed, then proudly threw back the tarpaulin. Sitting so close to the desk, I could see that the covers of the books, a motley red, were badly worn and that the gray edges of the pages had been marred by pencils, crayons, and ink. My anticipation at having my own book ebbed to a sinking disappointment. But Miss Crocker continued to beam as she called each fourth grader to her desk and, recording a number in her roll book, handed him or her a book. As I returned from my trip to her desk, I noticed the first graders anxiously watching the disappearing pile. Miss Crocker must have noticed them too, for as I sat down she said, 'Don't worry, little ones, there are plenty of readers for you too. See there on Miss Davis's desk.' Wide eyes turned to the covered teacher's platform directly in front of them and an audible sigh of relief swelled in the room. I glanced across at Little Man, his face lit in eager excitement. I knew that he could not see the soiled covers or the marred pages from where he sat, and even though his penchant for cleanliness was often annoying, I did not like to think of his disappointment when he saw the books as they really were. But there was nothing that I could do about it, so I opened my book to its center and began browsing through the spotted pages. Girls with blond braids and boys with blue eyes stared up at me. I found a story about a boy and his dog lost in a cave and began reading while Miss Crocker's voice droned on monotonously. Suddenly I grew conscious of a break in that monotonous tone and I looked up. Miss Crocker was sitting at Miss Davis's desk with the first-grade books stacked before her, staring fiercely down at Little Man, who was pushing a book back upon the desk. 'What's that you said, Clayton Chester Logan !' she asked. The room became gravely silent. Everyone knew that Little Man was in big trouble for no one, but no one, ever called Little Man 'Clayton Chester' unless she or he meant serious business. Little Man knew this too. His lips parted slightly as he took his hands from the book. He quivered, but he did not take his eyes from Miss Crocker.'I –I said may I have another book please, ma'am,' he squeaked. 'That one's dirty.' 'Dirty !' Miss Crocker echoed, appalled by such temerity. She stood up, gazing down upon Little Man like a bony giant, but Little Man raised his head and continued to look into her eyes. 'Dirty! And just who do you think you are, Clayton Chester! Here the county is giving us these wonderful books during these hard times and you're going to stand there and tell me that the book's too dirty! Now you take that book or get nothing at all I' Little Man lowered his eyes and said nothing as he stared at the book, For several moments he stood there, his face barely visible above the desk, then he turned and looked at the few remaining books and, seeming to realize that they were as badly soiled as the one Miss Crocker had given him. he looked across the room at me. I nodded and Little Man, glancing up again at Miss Crocker, slid the book from the edge of the desk, and with his back straight and his head up returned to his seat. Miss Crocker sat down again. 'Some people around here seem to be giving themselves airs. I’ll tolerate no more of that.' she scowled. 'Sharon Lake, come get your book. I watched Little Man as he scooted into his seat beside two other little boys. He sat for a while with a stony face looking out the window; then, evidently accepting the fact that the book in front of him was the best that he could expect, he turned and opened it. Rut as he stared at the book's inside cover, his face clouded, changing from sulky acceptance to puzzlement. His brews furrowed. Then his eyes grew wide, and suddenly he sucked in his breath and sprang from his chair like a wounded animal, hinging the book onto the floor and stomping madly upon it. Miss Crocker rushed to Little Man and grabbed him up in powerful hands. She shook him vigorously, then set him on the floor again, 'Now, just what's gotten into you, Clayton Chester!' But Little Man said nothing. He just stood staring down at the open book, shivering with indignant anger. 'Pick it up,' she ordered. 'No !' defied Little Man. 'No! I'll give you ten seconds to pick up that book, boy. or I'm going to get my switch.' Little Man bit his lower lip, and I knew that he was not going to pick up the book. Rapidly, I turned to the inside cover of my own book and saw immediately what had made Little Man so furious. Stamped on the inside cover was a chart which read: The blank lines continued down to line 20 and I knew that they had all been reserved for black students. A knot of anger swelled in my throat and held there. But as Miss Crocker directed Little Man to bend over the 'whipping chair. 1 put aside my anger and jumped up. 'Miz Crocker. don't, please !' I cried. Miss Crocker's dark eyes warned me not to say another word. 'I know why he done it !' 'You want part of this switch, Cassie !' 'No'm,' I said hastily. 'I just wanna tell you how come Little Man done what he done.' 'Sit down!' she ordered as I hurried toward her with the open book in my hand, Holding the book up to her. I said. 'See, Miz Crocker, see what it says. They give us these ole books when they didn't want'em no more. She regarded me impatiently, but did not look at the book. 'Now how could he know what it says! He can't read.' 'Yes'm, he can. He been reading since he was four. He can't read all them big words, but he can read them columns. See what's in the last row. Please look, Miz Crocker. This time Miss Crocker did look, but her face did not change. Then, holding up her head, she gazed unblinkingly down at me. 'S-see what they called us,' I said, afraid she had not seen. 'That's what you are.' she said coldly. 'Now go sit down. I shook my head, realizing now that Miss Crocker did not even know what I was talking about, She had looked at the page and had understood nothing, 'I said sit down. Cassie !' I started slowly toward my desk, but as the hickory stick sliced the tense air. I turned back around. 'Miz Crocker,' I said, 'I don't want my book neither. The switch landed hard upon Little Man's upturned bottom. Miss Crocker looked questioningly at me as I reached up to her desk and placed the book upon it. Then she swung the switch five more times and, discovering that Little Man had no intention of crying, ordered him up. 'All right, Cassie,' she sighed, turning to me, 'come on and get yours.' By the end of the school day I had decided that I would tell Mama everything before Miss Crocker had a chance to do so. From nine years of trial and error, I had learned that punishment was always less severe when I poured out the whole truth to Mama on my own before she had heard anything from anyone else. I knew that Miss Crocker had not spoken to Mama during the lunch period, for she had spent the whole hour in the classroom preparing for the afternoon session. As soon as class was dismissed I sped from the room, weaving a path through throngs of students happy to be free. But before I could reach the seventh-grade-class building. I had the misfortune to collide with Mary Lou's father. Mr. Wellever looked down on me with surprise that I would actually bump into him, then proceeded to lecture me on the virtues of watching where one was going. Meanwhile Miss Crocker briskly crossed the lawn to Mama's class building. By the time I escaped Mr. Wellever, she had already disappeared into the darkness of the hallway, Mama's classroom was in the back, I crept silently along the quiet hall and peeped cautiously into the open doorway, Mama, pushing a strand of her long, crinkly hair back into the chignon at the base of her slender neck, was seated at her desk watching Miss Crocker thrust a book before her, 'Just look at that. Mary,' Miss Crocker said, thumping the book twice with her forefinger. 'A perfectly good book ruined. Look at that broken binding and those foot marks all over it.' Mama did not speak as she studied the book. 'And here's the one Cassie wouldn't take.' she said, placing a second book on Mama's desk with an outraged slam. 'At least she didn't have a tantrum and stomp all over hers. I tell you, Mary. I just don't know what got into those children today. I always knew Cassie was rather high-strung, but Little Man! He's always such a perfect little gentle- man.' Mama glanced at the book I had rejected and opened the front cover so that the offensive pages of both books faced her. 'You say Cassie said it was because of this front page that she and Little Man didn't want the books !' Mama asked quietly. 'Yes, ain't that something!' Miss Crocker said, forgetting her teacher-training-school diction in her indignation. 'The very idea! That's on all the books, and why they got so upset about it I'll never know.' 'You punish them!' asked Mama, glancing up at Miss Crocker. 'Well, I certainly did ! Whipped both of them good with my hickory stick. Wouldn't you have!' When Mama did not reply, she added defensively, 'I had a perfect right to.' 'Of course you did. Daisy.' Mama said, turning back to the books again. 'They disobeyed you.' But her tone was so quiet and noncommittal that I knew Miss Crocker was not satisfied with her reaction. 'Well, I thought you would've wanted to know, Mary, in case you wanted to give them a piece of your mind also.' Mama smiled up at Miss Crocker and said rather absently, ‘Yes, of course, Daisy. Thank you.' Then she opened her desk drawer and pulled out some paper, a pair of scissors. and a small brown bottle. Miss Crocker, dismayed by Mama's seeming unconcern for the seriousness of the matter, thrust her shoulders back and began moving away from the desk. ‘You understand that if they don't have those books to study from, I’ll have to fail them in both reading and composition, since i plan to base all my lessons around -' She stopped abruptly and stared in amazement at Mama. ‘Mary, what in the world are you doing!' Mama did not answer. She had trimmed the paper to the size of the books and was now dipping a gray-looking glue from the brown bottle onto the inside cover of one of the books. Then she took the paper and placed it over the glue. 'Mary Logan, do you know what you're doing! That book belongs to the county. If somebody from the superintendent's office ever comes down here and sees that book, you'll be in real trouble.' Mama laughed and picked up the other book. 'In the first place no one cares enough to come down here, and in the second place if anyone should come, maybe he could see all the things we need - current books for all of our subjects, not just somebody's old throwaways, desks, paper, black- boards, erasers, maps, chalk ...' Her voice trailed off as she glued the second book. 'Biting the hand that feeds you. That's what you're doing, Mary Logan, biting the hand that feeds you.' Again, Mama laughed. 'If that's the case. Daisy, T don't think I need that little bit of food.' With the second book finished, she stared at a small pile of seventh-grade books on her desk. 'Well, I just think you're spoiling those children, Mary. They've got to learn how things are sometime.' 'Maybe so,' said Mama, ‘but that doesn't mean they have to accept them ... and maybe we don't either.' Miss Crocker gazed suspiciously at Mama. Although Mama had been a teacher at Great Faith for fourteen years, ever since she had graduated from the Crandon Teacher Training School at nineteen, she was still considered by many of the other teachers as a disrupting maverick. Her ideas were always a bit too radical and her statements a bit too pointed. The fact that she had not grown up in Spokane County but in the Delta made her even more suspect, and the more traditional. thinkers like Miss Crocker were wary of her. ‘Well, if anyone ever does come from the county and sees Cassie's and Little Man's books messed up like that,' she said, ‘I certainly won't accept the responsibility for them. 'It will be easy enough for anyone to see whose responsibility it is, Daisy, by opening any seventh-grade book. Because tomorrow I'm going to ""mess them up"" too. Miss Crocker, finding nothing else to say, turned imperiously and headed for the door. I dashed across the hall and awaited her exit, then crept back. Mama remained at her desk, sitting very still. For a long time she did not move. When she did, she picked up one of the seventh-grade books and began to glue again. I wanted to go and help her, but something warned me that now was not the time to make my presence known, and I left. I would wait until the evening to talk to her; there was no rush now. She understood. Two 'Cassie, you better watch yourself, girl,' Big Ma cautioned, putting one rough, large hand against my back to make sure I didn't fall. I looked down at my grandmother from midway up one of the wooden poles Papa had set out to mark the length of the cotton field. Big Ma was Papa's mother, and like him she was tall and strongly built. Her clear, smooth skin was the color of a pecan shell. 'Ah, Big Ma, I ain't gonna fall.' I scoffed, then climbed onto the next strong spike and reached for a fibrous puff at the top of a tall cotton stalk. 'You she' better not fall, girl,' grumbled Big Ma. 'Sometimes I wish we had more low cotton like down 'round Vicksburg. I don't like y'all children climbin' them things.' She looked around, her hand on her hip. Christopher-John and Little Man farther down the field balanced skillfully on lower spikes of their own poles plucking the last of the cot- ton, but Stacey, too heavy now to climb the poles, was forced to remain on the ground. Big Ma eyed us all again, then with a burlap bag slung across her right shoulder and dangling at the left side of her waist she moved down the row toward Mama. ‘Mary, child. I think with what we picked today we oughta have ourselves another bale.' Mama was stooped over a low cotton branch. She stuffed one last puff into her bag and straightened. She was tawny- colored, thin and sinewy, with delicate features in a strong- jawed face, and though almost as tall as Big Ma, she seemed somewhat dwarfed beside her. 'I expect you're right, Mama,' she said. ‘Come Monday, we'd better haul it up to the Granger place and have it ginned. Then we can - Cassie, what's the matter !' I didn't answer Mama. I had moved to the very top of my pole and could now see above the field to the road where two figures, one much taller than the other, were walking briskly. As the men rounded a curve in the road, they became more distinct. There was in the easy fluid gait of the shorter man a familiarity that made me gasp. I squinted, shadowing my eyes from the sun, then slipped like lightning down the pole. 'Cassie!' 'It's Papa!' 'David!' Mama questioned unbelievingly as Christopher- John and Little Man descended eagerly and dashed after Stacey and me toward the barbed-wire fence. 'Don't y'all go through that fence!' Big Ma called after us. But we pretended not to hear. We held the second and third rows of the prickly wire wide for each other to climb through: then all four of us sped down the road toward Papa. When Papa saw us, he began running swiftly, easily, like the wind. Little Man, the first to reach him, was swept lightly upward in Papa's strong hands as Christopher-John, Stacey, and I crowded around. 'Papa, what you doing home!' asked Little Man. Putting Little Man down, Papa said, ‘Just had to come home and see 'bout my babies.' He hugged and kissed each of us, then stood back. ‘Just look at y'all,' he said proudly. 'Ain't y'all something! Can't hardly call y'all babies no more.' He turned. 'Mr. Morrison, what you think 'bout these children of mine !' In our excitement, we had taken no notice of the other man standing quietly at the side of the road. But now, gazing upward at the most formidable-looking being we had ever encountered, we huddled closer to Papa. The man was a human tree in height, towering high above Papa's six feet two inches. The long trunk of his massive body bulged with muscles, and his skin, of the deepest ebony, was partially scarred upon his face and neck, as if by fire. Deep lifelines were cut into his face and his hair was splotched with gray, but his eyes were clear and penetrating. I glanced at the boys and it was obvious to me that they were wondering the same thing as I: Where had such a being come from ! 'Children,' said Papa, ‘meet Mr. L.T. Morrison. Each of us whispered a faint hello to the giant, then the six of us started up the road toward home. Before we reached the house, Mama and Big Ma met us. When Papa saw Mama, his square, highcheekboned face opened to a wide smile and, lifting Mama with spirited gusto, he swung her around twice before setting her down and kissing her. 'David. is something the matter !' she asked. Papa laughed. 'Something gotta be wrong, woman, for me to come see 'bout you !' 'You got my letter?' He nodded, then hugged and kissed Big Ma before introducing them both to Mr. Morrison. When we reached the house we climbed the long, sloping lawn to the porch and went into Mama and Papa's room, which also served as the living area. Mama offered Mr. Morrison Grandpa Logan's chair, a cushioned oak rocker skillfully crafted by Grandpa himself; but Mr. Morrison did not sit down immediately. Instead, he stood gazing at the room. It was a warm, comfortable room of doors and wood and pictures. From it a person could reach the front or the side porch, the kitchen, and the two other bedrooms. Its walls were made of smooth oak, and on them hung gigantic photographs of Grandpa and Big Ma. Papa and Uncle Hammer when they were boys, Papa's two eldest brothers, who were now dead, and pictures of Mama's family. The furniture, a mixture of Logan-crafted walnut and oak, included a walnut bed whose ornate headboard rose halfway up the wall toward the high ceiling, a grand chiffonier with a floor- length mirror, a large rolltop desk which had once been Grandpa's but now belonged to Mama, and the four oak chairs, two of them rockers, which Grandpa had made for Big Ma as a wedding present. Mr. Morrison nodded when he had t'aken it all in, as if he approved, then sat across from Papa in front of the unlit fireplace. The boys and I pulled up straight-backed chairs near Papa as Big Ma asked, ‘How long you gonna be home, son !' Papa looked across at her. Till Sunday evening,' he said quietly. 'Sunday!' Mama exclaimed. ‘Why, today's already Saturday, 'I know, baby,' Papa said, taking her hand, ‘but I gotta get that night train out of Vicksburg so I can get back to work by Monday morning. Christopher-John, Little Man, and I groaned loudly, and Papa turned to us. ‘Papa, can't you stay no longer than that! Last time you come home, you stayed a week,' I said. Papa gently pulled one of my pigtails. ‘Sorry, Cassie girl, but I stay any longer, I might lose my job. 'But, Papa – 'Listen, all of y'all,' he said, looking from me to the boys to Mama and Big Ma, 'I come home special so I could bring Mr. Morrison. He's gonna stay with us awhile.' If Mama and Big Ma were surprised by Papa's words. they did not show it, but the boys and I looked with wide eyes at each other, then at the giant. 'Mr. Morrison lost his job on the railroad a while back.' Papa continued. 'and he ain't been able to find anything else. When I asked him if he wanted to come work here as a hired hand, he said he would. I told him we couldn't afford much - food and shelter and a few dollars in cash when I come home in the winter.' Mama turned to Mr. Morrison, studied him for a moment, and said, 'Welcome to our home, Mr. Morrison.' 'Miz Logan.' said Mr. Morrison in a deep, quiet voice like the roll of low thunder. ‘I think you oughta know I got fired off my job. Got in a fight with some men ... beat'em up pretty bad.' Mama stared into Mr. Morrison's deep eyes.' Whose fault was it !' Mr. Morrison stared back. 'I'd say theirs. 'Did the other men get fired !' 'No. ma'am,' answered Mr. Morrison. 'They was white.' Mama nodded and stood. 'Thank you for telling me. Mr. Morrison. You're lucky no worse happened and we're glad to have you here .,.especially now.' Then she turned and went into the kitchen with Big Ma to prepare supper, leaving the boys and me to wonder about her last words. 'Stacey, what you think!' I asked as we milked the cows in the evening. ‘How come Papa come home and brung Mr. Morrison!' Stacey shrugged. ‘Like he said, I guess.' I thought on that a moment, 'Papa ain't never brung nobody here before.' Stacey did not reply, 'You think .,,Stacey, you think it's cause of them burnings T.J. was talking 'bout !' 'Burnings!' piped Little Man, who had interrupted his feeding of the chickens to visit with Lady, our golden mare. 'What's burnings gotta do with anything!' 'That happened way over by Smellings Creek,' said Stacey slowly, ignoring Little Man. 'Papa got no need to think ... His voice trailed off and he stopped milking. 'Think what !' I asked. 'Nothin'.' he muttered, turning back to the cow.'Don't worry 'bout it.' I glared at him. 'I ain't worrying. I just wanna know, that's all, and I betcha anything Mr. Morrison come here to do more'n work. Sure wish I knew for sure. Stacey made no reply, but Christopher-John, his pudgy hands filled with dried corn for the chickens and his lower lip quivering, said,'I –I know what I wish. I wish P-Papa didn't never have to go 'way no more. I wish he could just stay ... and stay...' At church the next morning, Mrs.. Silas Lanier leaned across me and whispered to Big Ma, 'John Henry Berry died last night.' When the announcement was made to the congregation, the deacons prayed for the soul of John Henry Berry and the recovery of his brother, Beacon, and his uncle, Mr. Samuel Berry. But after church, when some of the members stopped by the house to visit, angry hopeless words were spoken. The way I hears it,' said Mr. Lanier, ‘they been after John Henry ever since he come back from the war and settled on his daddy's place up by Smellings Creek. Had a nice little place up there too, and was doing pretty well. Left a wife and six children.' Big Ma shook her head. ‘Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. The boys and I sat at our study table pretending not to listen, but listening still. 'Henrietta Toggins,' said Mrs. Lanier, 'you know, Clara Davis's sister that live up there in Strawberry! Well, she's kin to the Berrys and she was with John Henry and Beacon when the trouble got started. They was gonna drop her off at home - you know John Henry had him one of them old Model-T pickups - but they needed some gas so they stopped by that fillin' station up there in Strawberry. They was waitin' there for they gas when some white men come up messin' with them - been drinkin', you know. And Henrietta heard 'em say, ""That's the nigger Sallie Ann said was flirtin with her."" And when she heard that, she said to John Henry, ""Let's get on outa here."" He wanted to wait for the gas, but she made him and Beacon get in that car, and them men jus' watched them drive off and didn't mess with 'em right then. 'John Henry, he took her on home then headed back for his own place, but evidently them men caught up with him and Beacon again and starts rammin' the back of they car - least that's what Beacon and John Henry told they aunt and uncle when they seed 'em. John Henry knowed he was runnin' outa gas and he was 'fraid he couldn't make it to his own place, so he stopped at his uncle's, But them men dragged him and Beacon both outa that house, and when old man Berry tried to stop it, they lit him afire with them boys.' 'It's she' a shame, all right,' said T.J.'s father, a frail, sickly man with a hacking cough. 'These folks gettin' so bad in here. Heard tell they lynched a boy a few days ago at Crosston.' 'And ain't a thing gonna be done 'bout it,' said Mr. Lanier. That's what's so terrible ! When Henrietta went to the sheriff and told him what she'd seed, he called her a liar and sent her on home. Now I hear tells that some of them men that done it been 'round braggin' 'bout it, Sayin' they'd do it again if some uppity nigger get out of line.' Mrs. Avery asked, 'Lord have mercy I' Papa sat very quietly while the Laniers and the Averys talked, studying them with serious eyes. Finally, he took the pipe from his mouth and made a statement that seemed to the boys and me to be totally disconnected with the conversation. 'In this family, we don't shop at the Wallace store.' The room became silent. The boys and I stared at the adults wondering why, The Laniers and the Averys looked uneasily about them and when the silence was broken, the subject had changed to the sermon of the day, After the Laniers and the Averys had left. Papa called us to him. 'Your mama tells me that a lot of the older children been going up to that Wallace store after school to dance and buy their bootleg liquor and smoke cigarettes. Now she said she's already told y'all this, but I'm gonna tell y'all again, so listen good. We don't want y'all going to that place. Children going there are gonna get themselves in a whole lot of trouble one day. There's drinking up there and I don't like it - and I don't like them Wallaces either. If I ever find out y'all been up there, for any reason, I'm gonna wear y'all out. Y'all hear me !' 'Yessir, Papa.' piped Christopher-John readily. 'I ain't never going up there. The rest of us agreed: Papa always meant what he said - and he swung a mean switch. Three By the end of October the rain had come, falling heavily upon the six-inch layer of dust which had had its own way for more than two months. At first the rain had merely splotched the dust, which seemed to be rejoicing in its own resiliency and laughing at the heavy drops thudding against it: but eventually the dust was forced to surrender to the mastery of the rain and it churned into a fine red mud that oozed between our toes and slopped against our ankles as we marched miserably to and from school. To shield us from the rain, Mama issued us dried calf- skins which we flung over our heads and shoulders like stiff cloaks. We were not very fond of the skins, for once they were wet they emitted a musty odor which seeped into our clothing and clung to our skins. We preferred to do with- out them; unfortunately, Mama cared very little about what we preferred. Since we usually left for school after Mama, we solved this problem by dutifully cloaking ourselves with the skins before leaving home. As soon as we were beyond Big Ma's eagle eyes, we threw off the cloaks and depended upon the overhanging limbs of the forest trees to keep us dry. Once at school, we donned the cloaks again and marched into our respective classrooms properly attired. If we had been faced only with the prospect of the rain soaking through our clothing each morning and evening, we could have more easily endured the journey between home and school. But as it was, we also had to worry about the Jefferson Davis school bus zooming frolic behind and splashing us with the murky waters of the road. Knowing that the bus driver liked to entertain his passengers by sending us slipping along the road to the almost inaccessible forest banks washed to a smooth baldness by the constant rains, we continuously looked over our shoulders when we were between the two crossroads so that we could reach the bank before the bus was upon us. But sometimes the rain pounded so heavily that it was all we could do to stay upright, and we did not look back as often nor listen as carefully as we should; we consequently found ourselves comical objects to cruel eyes that gave no thought to our misery. No one was more angered by this humiliation than Little Man. Although he had asked Mama after the first day of school why Jefferson Davis had two buses and Great Faith had none, he had never been totally satisfied by her answer. She had explained to him, as she had explained to Christopher-John the year before and to me two years before that, that the county did not provide buses for its black students. In fact, she said, the county provided very little and much of the money which supported the black schools came from the black churches. Great Faith Church just could not afford a bus, so therefore we had to walk. This information cut deeply into Little Man's brain, and each day when he found his clean clothes splashed red by the school bus, he became more and more embittered until finally one day he stomped angrily into the kitchen and exploded. ‘They done it again, Big Ma! Just look at my clothes!' Big Ma clucked her tongue as she surveyed us.' Well, go on and get out of'em, honey, and wash 'em out. All of y'all, get out of them clothes and dry yo'selves.' she said, turning back to the huge iron-bellied stove to stir her stew. 'But, Big Ma, it ain't fair!' wailed Little Man. 'It just ain't fair. Stacey and Christopher-John left to change into their work clothes, but Little Man sat on the side bench looking totally dejected as he gazed at his pale-blue pants crusted with mud from the knees down. Although each night Big Ma prepared a pot of hot soapy water for him to wash out his clothing, each day he arrived home looking as if his pants had not been washed in more than a month. Big Ma was not one for coddling any of us, but now she turned from the stove and, wiping her hands on her long white apron, sat down on the bench and put her arm around Little Man. 'Now, look here, baby, it ain't the end of the world. Lord. child. don't you know one day the sun'll shine again and you won't get muddy no more !' 'But. Big Ma.' Little Man protested. 'ifn that ole bus driver would slow down, I wouldn't get muddy!' Then he frowned deeply and added, 'Or ifn we had a bus like theirs.' 'Well. he don't and you don't,' Big Ma said, getting up. 'So ain't no use frettin' 'bout it. One day you'll have a plenty of clothes and maybe even a car of yo' own to ride 'round in, so don't you pay no mind to them ignorant white folks. You jus' keep on studyin' and get yo'self a good education and you'll be all right. Now. go on and wash out yo' clothes and hang 'em by the fire so's I can iron 'em 'fore I go to bed.' Turning. she spied me. 'Cassie, what you want, girl! Go change into yo' pants and hurry on back here so's you can help me get this supper on the table time yo' mama get hom'e. That night when I was snug in the deep feathery bed beside Big Ma, the tat-tat of the rain against the tin roof changed to a deafening roar that sounded as if thousands of giant rocks were being hurled against the earth. By morning the heavy rain had become a drizzle, but the earth was badly sodden from the night's downpour. High rivers of muddy water flowed in the deep gullies, and wide lakes shimmered on the roads. As we set out for school the whiteness of the sun at- tempted to penetrate the storm clouds, but by the time we had turned north toward the second crossing it had given up, slinking meekly behind the blackening clouds. Soon the thunder rolled across the sky, and the rain fell like hail upon our bent heads. 'Ah, shoot! I sure am gettin' tired of this mess,' complained T.J. But no one else said a word. We were listening for the bus. Although we had left home earlier than usual to cover the northern road before the bus came, we were not overly confident that we would miss it, for we had tried this strategy before. Sometimes it worked; most times it didn't, It was as if the bus were a living thing, plaguing and defeating us at every turn. We could not outwit it. We plodded along feeling the cold mud against our feet, walking faster and faster to reach the crossroads. Then ChristopherJohn stopped. 'Hey, y'all, I think I hear it,' he warned. We looked around, but saw nothing. 'Ain't nothin' yet,' I said. We walked on. 'Wait a minute,' said Christopher-John, stopping a second time. ‘There it is again.' We turned but still there was nothing. 'Why don't you clean out your ears!' T.J. exclaimed. 'Wait,' said Stacey, 'I think I hear it too.' We hastened up the road to where the gully was narrower and we could easily swing up the bank into the forest. Soon the purr of a motor came closer and Mr. Granger's sleek silver Packard eased into view. It was a grand car with chrome shining even in the rain, and the only one like it in the county, so it was said. We groaned. 'Jus' ole Harlan,' said T,J. flippantly as the expensive car rounded a curve and disappeared, then he and Claude started down the bank. Stacey stopped them. ‘Long as we're already up here, why don't we wait awhile.' he suggested. ‘The bus oughta be here soon and it'll be harder to get up on the bank further down the road. 'Ah, man, that bus ain't comin' for a while yet,' said T.J. 'We left early this mornin', remember !' Stacey looked to the south, thinking. Little Man, Christopher-John and I waited for his decision. 'Come on, man.' T.J. persuaded. ‘Why stay up here waitin' for that devilish bus when we could be at school outa this mess !' T.J. and Claude jumped from the bank. Then Stacey, frowning as if he were doing this against his better judgment, jumped down too. Little Man, Christopher-John, and I followed, Five minutes later we were skidding like frightened puppies toward the bank again as the bus accelerated and barreled down the narrow rain-soaked road; but there was no place to which we could run. for Stacey had been right. Here the gullies were too wide, filled almost to overflowing, and there were no briars or bushes by which we could swing up onto the bank. Finally, when the bus was less than fifty feet behind us, it veered dangerously close to the right edge of the road where we were running, forcing us to attempt the jump to the bank; but all of us fell short and landed in the slime of the gully. Little Man, chest-deep in water, scooped up a handful of mud and in an uncontrollable rage scrambled up to the road and ran after the retreating bus. As moronic rolls of laughter and cries of 'Nigger! Nigger ! Mud eater !' wafted from the open windows, Little Man threw his mudball, missing the wheels by several feet. Then, totally dismayed by what had happened. he buried his face in his hands and cried. T.J. climbed from the gully grinning at Little Man, but Stacey, his face burning red beneath his dark skin, glared so fiercely at T.J. that he fell back. 'Just one word outa you, T.J.,' he said tightly. 'Just one word. Christopher-John and I looked at each other. We had never seen Stacey look like this. and neither had T.J. 'Hey, man, I ain't said nothin' ! I'm jus' as burnt as you are. Stacey glowered at T.J. a moment longer, then walked swiftly to Little Man and put his long arm around his shoulders, saying softly, 'Come on, Man. It ain't gonna happen no more, least not for a long while. I promise you that.' Again, Christopher-John and I looked questioningly at each other, wondering how Stacey could make such a rash promise. Then, shrugging, we hurried after him, When Jeremy Simms spied us from his high perch on the forest path, he ran hastily down and joined us. 'Hey,' he said, his face lighting into a friendly grin, But no one spoke to him. The smile faded and, noticing our mud-covered clothing, he asked, 'Hey, St-Stacey, wh-what happened!' Stacey turned, stared into his blue eyes and said coldly, 'Why don't you leave us alone! How come you-always hanging ‘round us anyway I' Jeremy grew even more pale. 'C-cause I just likes y'all,' he stammered. Then he whispered. 'W-was it the bus again!' No one answered him and he said no more. When we reached the crossroads, he looked hopefully at us as if we might relent and say good-bye. But we did not relent and as I glanced back at him standing alone in the middle of the crossing, he looked as if the world itself was slung around his neck. It was only then that I realized that Jeremy never rode the bus, no matter how bad the weather. As we crossed the school lawn, Stacey beckoned Christopher-John. Little Man, and me aside. 'Look,' he whispered, 'meet me at the tool shed right at noon.' 'Why!' we asked. He eyed us conspiratorially. 'I’ll show y'all how we're gonna stop that bus from splashing us.' 'How !' asked Little Man, eager for revenge. 'Don't have time to explain now. Just meet me. And be on time. It's gonna take us all lunch hour. 'Y-you mean we ain't gonna eat no lunch !' Christopher- John cried in dismay. 'You can miss lunch for one day,' said Stacey, moving away. But Christopher-john looked sourly after him as if he greatly questioned the wisdom of a plan so drastic that it could exclude lunch. 'You gonna tell T.J. and Claude!' I asked. Stacey shook his head. 'T.J.'s my best friend. but he's got no stomach for this kinda thing. He talks too much, and we couldn't include Claude without T.J,' 'Good,' said Little Man. At noon, we met as planned and ducked into the unlocked tool shed where all the church and school garden tools were kept. Stacey studied the tools available while the rest of us watched. Then, grabbing the only shovels, he handed one to me, holding on to the other himself, and directed Little Man and Christopher-John to each take two buckets. Stealthily emerging from the tool shed into the drizzle, we eased along the forest edge behind the class buildings to avoid being seen. Once on the road, Stacey began to run. 'Come on. hurry,' he ordered. 'We ain't got much time.' 'Where we going!' asked Christopher-John, still not quite adjusted to the prospect of missing lunch. 'Up to where that bus forced us off the road. Be careful now,' he said to Christopher-John, already puffing to keep up. When we reached the place where we had fallen into the gully, Stacey halted. ‘All right,' he said, ‘start digging. Without another word, he put his bare foot upon the top edge of the shovel and sank it deep into the soft road. 'Come on, come on,' he ordered, glancing up at Christopher- John, Little Man and me, who were wondering whether he had finally gone mad. 'Cassie, you start digging over there on that side of the road right across from me. That's right, don't get to~· near the edge. It's gotta look like it's been washed out. Christopher-John, you and Little Man start scooping out mud from the middle of the road. Quick now,' he said, still digging as we began to carry out his commands. ‘We only got 'bout thirty minutes so's we can get back to school on time.' We asked no more questions. While Stacey and I shoveled ragged holes almost a yard wide and a foot deep toward each other, dumping the excess mud into the water-filled gullies, Little Man and Christopher-John scooped bucketfuls of the red earth from the road's center. And for once in his life, Little Man was happily oblivious to the mud spattering upon him. When Stacey's and my holes merged into one big hole with Little Man's and Christopher-John's. Stacey and I threw down our shovels and grabbed the extra buckets. Then the four of us ran back and forth to the gullies, hastily filling the buckets with the murky water and dumping it into the hole, Now understanding Stacey's plan. we worked wordlessly until the water lay at the same level as the road. Then Stacey waded into the gully water and pulled himself up onto the forest bank. Finding three rocks, he stacked them to identify the spot. 'It might look different this after-noon.' he explained, jumping down again. Christopher-John looked up at the sky. 'looks like it's gonna rain real hard some more.' 'Let's hope so,' said Stacey. 'The more rain, the better. That'll make it seem more likely that the road could've been washed away like that. It'll also keep cars and wagons away.' He looked around, surveying the road.'And let's hope don't nothin' come along 'fore that bus. Let's go. Quickly we gathered our buckets and shovels and hurried back to school. After returning the tools to the tool shed, we stopped at the well to wash the mud from our arms and feet, then rushed into our classes, hoping that the mud caked on our clothes would go unnoticed. As I slipped into my seat Miss Crocker looked at me oddly and shook her head. but when she did the same thing as Mary Lou and Alma sat down, I decided that my mud was no more noticeable than anyone else's. Soon after I had settled down to the boredom of Miss Crocker, the rain began to pound down again, hammering with great intensity upon the tin roof. After school it was still raining as the boys and I, avoiding T.J. and Claude, rushed along the slippery road recklessly bypassing more cautious students. 'You think we'll get there in time to see, Stacey!' I asked. 'We should. They stay in school fifteen minutes longer than we do and it always takes them a few minutes to load up.' When we reached the crossing, we glanced toward Jefferson Davis. The buses were there but the students had not been dismissed. We hastened on. Expecting to see the yard-wide ditch we had dug at noon, we were not prepared for the twelve-foot lake which glimmered up at us. 'Holy smokes ! What happened!' I exclaimed. 'The rain,' said Stacey. ‘Quick, up on the bank.' Eagerly, we settled onto the muddy forest floor and waited. 'Hey, Stacey.' I said, ‘won’t that big a puddle make that ole driver cautious!' Stacey frowned, then said uncertainly, ‘I don't know. Hope not. There's big puddles down the road that ain't deep. just water heavy. 'If I was to be walking out there when the bus comes, that ole bus driver would be sure to speed up so's he could splash me,' I suggested. 'Or maybe me,' Little Man volunteered, ready to do anything for his revenge. Stacey thought a moment, but decided against it. 'Naw. It's better none of us be on the road when it happens. It might give 'em ideas.' 'Stacey, what if they find out we done it!' asked Christopher-John nervously. 'Don't worry, they won't,' assured Stacey. 'Hey, I think it's coming,' whispered Little Man. We flattened ourselves completely and peered through the low bushes, The bus rattled up the road, though not as quickly as we had hoped. It rolled cautiously through a wide puddle some twenty feet ahead; then, seeming to grow bolder as it approached our man-made lake, it speeded up, spraying the water in high sheets of backward waterfalls into the forest. We could hear the students squealing with delight. But instead of the graceful glide through the puddle that its occupants were expecting, the bus emitted a tremendous crack and careened drunkenly into our trap. For a moment it swayed and we held our breath, afraid that it would topple over. Then it sputtered a last murmuring protest and died, its left front wheel in our ditch, its right wheel in the gully, like a lopsided billy goat on its knees. We covered our mouths and shook with silent laughter. As the dismayed driver opened the rear emergency exit, the rain poured down upon him in sharp-needled darts. He stood in the doorway looking down with disbelief at his sunken charge; then, holding on to the bus, he poked one foot into the water until it was on solid ground before gingerly stepping down. He looked under the bus. He looked at the steaming hood. He looked at the water. Then he scratched his head and cursed. 'How bad is it, Mr. Grimes?' a large, freckle-faced boy asked, pushing up one of the cracked windows and sticking out his head. 'Can we push it out and fix it !' 'Push it out! Fix it!' the bus driver echoed angrily. 'I got me a broken axle here an' a water-logged engine no doubt and no tellin' what-all else and you talkin' 'bout fixin' it! Y'all come on, get outa there! Y'all gonna have to walk home.' 'Mister Grimes,' a girl ventured, stepping hesitantly from the rear of the bus, 'you gonna be able to pick us up in the mornin' !' The bus driver stared at her in total disbelief. 'Girl, all y'all gonna be walkin' for at least two weeks by the time we get this thing hauled outa here and up to Strawberry to get fixed. Now y'all get on home.' He kicked a back tire, and added, 'And get y'all's daddies to come on up here and give me a hand with this thing. The students turned dismally from the bus. They didn't know how wide the hole actually was. Some of them took a wild guess and tried to jump it; but most of them miscalculated and fell in, to our everlasting delight. Others attempted to hop over the gullies to the forest to bypass the hole; however, we knew from much experience that they would not make it. By the time most of the students managed to get to the other side of the ditch, their clothes were dripping with the weight of the muddy water. No longer laughing, they moved spiritlessly toward their homes while a disgruntled Mr. Grimes leaned moodily against the raised rear end of the bus. Oh, how sweet was well-maneuvered revenge ! With that thought in mind, we quietly eased away and picked our way through the dense forest toward home. At supper Mama told Big Ma of the Jefferson Davis bus being stuck in the ditch. 'It's funny, you know, such a wide ditch in one day. I didn't even notice the beginning of it this morning - did you, children !' 'No'm.' we chorused. 'You didn't fall in, did you !' 'We jumped onto the bank when we thought the bus would be coming,' said Stacey truthfully. 'Well, good for you,' approved Mama. 'If that bus hadn't been there when I came along, I'd probably have fallen in myself. The boys and I looked at each other. We hadn't thought about that. 'How'd you get across, Mama !' Stacey asked. 'Somebody decided to put a board across the washout.' They gonna haul that bus outa there tonight!' Big Ma inquired. 'No, ma'am,' said Mama. 'I heard Mr. Granger telling Ted Grimes - the bus driver - that they won't be able to get it out until the rain stops and it dries up a bit. It's just too muddy now. We put our hands to our mouths to hide happy grins. I even made a secret wish that it would rain until Christmas. Mama smiled. ‘You know I'm glad no one was hurt - could've been too with such a deep ditch - but I'm also rather glad it happened.' 'Mary !' Big Ma exclaimed. 'Well, I am.' Mama said defiantly, smiling smugly to her- self and looking very much like a young girl. 'I really am.' Big Ma began to grin. 'You know somethin' ? I am too.' Then all of us began to laugh and were deliciously happy. Later that evening the boys and I sat at the study table in Mama and Papa's room attempting to concentrate on our lessons; but none of us could succeed for more than a few minutes without letting out a triumphant giggle. More than once Mama scolded us, telling us to get down to business. Each time she did, we set our fates into looks: of great seriousness, resolved that we would be adult about the matter and not gloat in our hour of victory. Yet just one glance at each other and we were lost, slumping on the table in helpless, contagious laughter. 'All right,' Mama said finally, 'I don't know what's going on here, but I suppose I'd better do something about it or you'll never get any work done.' It occurred to us that Mama might be preparing to whip us and we shot each other warning glances. But even that thought couldn't dampen our laughter, now uncontrollable, welling up from the pits of our stomachs and forcing streams of laughter tears down our faces. Stacey, holding his sides, turned to the wall in an attempt to bring himself under control. Little Man put his head under the table. But Christopher-John and I just doubled up and fell upon the floor. Mama took my arm and pulled me up. 'Over here, Cassie,' she said, directing me to a chair next to the fireplace and behind Big Ma, who was ironing our clothes for the next day. I peeped around Big Ma's long skirts and saw Mama guiding Stacey to her own desk. Then back she went for Little Man and, picking him up bodily, set him in the chair beside her rocker. Christopher-John she left alone at the study table. Then she gathered all our study materials and brought them to us along with a look that said she would tolerate no more of this foolishness. With Big Ma before me, I could see nothing else and I grew serious enough to complete my arithmetic assignment. When that was finished, I lingered before opening my reader, watching Big Ma as she hung up my ironed dress, then placed her heavy iron on a small pile of embers burning in a corner of the fireplace and picked up a second iron already warming there. She tested the iron with a tap of her finger and put it back again. While Big Ma waited for the iron to get hot. I could see Mama bending over outspread newspapers scraping the dried mud off the old field shoes of Papa's which she wore daily, stuffed with wads of newspaper, over her own shoes to protect them from the mud and rain. Little Man beside her was deep into his first-grade reader, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. Ever since Mama had brought the reader home with the offensive inside cover no longer visible, Little Man had accepted the book as a necessary tool for passing the first grade. But he took no pride in it. Looking up. he noticed that Big Ma was now preparing to iron his clothes, and he smiled happily, Then his eyes met mine and silent laughter creased his face. I muffled a giggle and Mama looked up. 'Cassie, you start up again and I'm sending you to the kitchen to study.' she warned. 'Yes'm,' I said, settling back in my chair and beginning to read. I certainly did not want to go to the kitchen. Now that the fire no longer burned in the stove, it was cold in there. The room grew quiet again, except for the earthy humming of Big Ma's rich alto voice, the crackle of the hickory fire, and the patter of rain on the roof. Engrossed in a mystery, I was startled when the comfortable sounds were shattered by three rapid knocks on the side door. Rising quickly, Mama went to the door and called, ‘Who is it!' 'It's me, ma'am,' came a man's gravelly voice. ‘Joe Avery. Mama opened the door and Mr. Avery stepped dripping into the room. 'Why, Brother Avery.' Mama said. ‘what are you doing out on a night like this ? Come on in. Take off your coat and sit by the fire. Stacey, get Mr. Avery a chair. 'No'm,' said Mr. Avery, looking rather nervously over his shoulder into the night. 'I ain't got but a minute.' He stepped far enough into the room so that he could close the door, then nodded to the rest of us. 'Evenin', Miz Caroline, how you t'night!' 'Oh, I’ll do, I reckon,' said Big Ma, still ironing. 'How's Miz Fannie!' 'She's fine,' he said without dwelling on his wife.'Miz Logan ... uh, I come to tell you somethin'... somethin' important - Mr. Morrison here!' Mama stiffened. 'David. You heard something about David !' 'Oh, no'm,' replied Mr. Avery hastily. 'Ain't heard nothin 'bout yo' husband, ma'am. Mama regarded him quizzically. 'It's ..,it's them again. They's ridin' t'night.' Mama, her face pale and frightened, glanced back at Big Ma; Big Ma held her iron in midair. 'Uh ... children,' Mama said ,'I think it's your bedtime.' 'But, Mama -' we chorused in protest, wanting to stay and hear who was riding. 'Hush.' Mama said sternly. 'I said it was time to go to bed. Now go!' Groaning loudly enough to voice our displeasure, but not loudly enough to arouse Mama's anger, we stacked our books upon the study table and started toward the boys room. 'Cassie, I said go to bed. That's not your room.' 'But, Mama, it's cold in there,' I pouted. Usually, we were allowed to build small fires in the other rooms an hour before bedtime to warm them up. 'You'll be warm once you're under the covers. Stacey, take the flashlight with you and light the lantern in your room. Cassie, take the lamp from the desk with you."" I went back and got the kerosene lamp, then entered my bedroom, leaving the door slightly ajar. 'Close that door, Cassie !' Immediately, the door was closed. I put the lamp on the dresser, then silently slid the latch off the outside door and slipped onto the wet front porch. I crossed to the boys' room. Tapping lightly, I whispered, 'Hey, let me in.' The door creaked open and I darted in. The room was bathed in darkness. 'What they say !' I asked. 'Shhhhh !' came the answer. I crept to the door leading into Mama's room and huddled beside the boys. The rain softened upon the roof and we could hear Mama asking, ‘But why? Why are they riding! What's happened?' 'I don't rightly know,' said Mr. Avery.'But y'all knows how they is. Anytime they thinks we steppin' outa our place, they feels like they gotta stop us. You know what some of'em done to the Berrys.' He paused, then went on bitterly, 'It don't take but a little of nothin' to set them devilish night men off.' 'But somethin' musta happened,' Big Ma said,'How you know 'bout it!' 'All's I can tell ya, Miz Caroline, is what Fannie heard when she was leavin' the Grangers' this evenin'. She'd just finished cleanin' up the supper dishes when Mr. Granger come home with Mr. Grimes - ya know, that white school's bus driver - and two other mens... A clap of deafening thunder drowned Mr. Avery's words, then the rain quickened and the conversation was lost. I grabbed Stacey's arm. ‘Stacey, they're coming after us!' 'What !' squeaked Christopher-John. 'Hush,' Stacey said harshly. 'And Cassie, let go. That hurts. 'Stacey, somebody musta seen and told on us,' I persisted. 'No ...' Stacey replied unconvincingly. 'It couldn't be.' 'Couldn't be?' cried Christopher-John in a panic. 'Whaddaya mean it couldn't be!' 'Stacey,' said Little Man excitedly, 'whaddaya think they gonna do to us ! Burn us up?' 'Nothin' !' Stacey exclaimed, standing up suddenly. ‘Now why don't y'all go to bed like y'all s'pose to!' We were stunned by his attitude. He sounded like Mama and I told him so. He collapsed in silence by the door, breathing hard, and although I could not see him, I knew that his face was drawn and that his eyes had taken on a haggard look. I touched his arm lightly. 'Ain't no call to go blaming your- self,' I said. 'We all done it.' 'But I got us into it,' he said listlessly. 'But we all wanted to do it,' I comforted. 'Not me!' denied Christopher-John. 'All I wanted to do was eat my lunch I' 'Shhhhh,' hissed Little Man.'I can hear 'em again.' 'I'd better go tell Mr. Morrison,' Mr. Avery was saying. 'He out back!' 'I'll tell him,' said Mama. We could hear the side door open and we scrambled up. 'Cassie, get back to your room quick,' Stacey whispered. They'll probably come check on us now. 'But what'll we do!' 'Nothin' now, Cassie. Them men probably won't even come near here.' 'Ya really believe that!' asked Christopher-John hopefully. 'But shouldn't we tell Mama ?' I asked. 'No! We can't ever tell nobody!' declared Stacey adamantly. 'Now go on, hurry !' Footsteps neared the door. I dashed onto the porch and hastened back to my own room, where I jumped under the bedcovers with my clothes still on. Shivering, I pulled the heavy patchwork quilts up to my chin. A few moments later Big Ma came in, leaving the door to Mama's room open. Knowing that she would be suspicious of such an early surrender to sleep, I sighed softly and, making sleepy little sounds, turned onto my stomach, careful not to expose my shirt sleeves. Obviously satisfied by my performance, Big Ma tucked the covers more closely around me and smoothed my hair gently. Then she stooped and started fishing for something under our bed. I opened my eyes. Now what the devil was she looking for down there! While she was searching, I heard Mama approaching and I closed my eyes again. 'Mama!' 'Stacey, what're you doing up?' 'Let me help.' 'Help with what !' 'With ... with whatever's the matter. Mama was silent a moment, then said softly, Thank you, Stacey, but Big Ma and I can handle it.' 'But Papa told me to help you !' 'And you do, more than you know. But right now you could help me most by going back to bed. It's a school day tomorrow, remember?’ 'But, Mama - 'If I need you, I'll call you. I promise.' I heard Stacey walk slowly away, then Mama whispering in the doorway, 'Cassie asleep!' 'Yeah, honey,' Big Ma said. 'Go on and sit back down. I'll be out in a minute.' Then Big Ma stood up and turned down the wick of the kerosene lamp. As she left the room, my eyes popped open again and I saw her outlined in the doorway, a rifle in her hands. Then she closed the door and I was left to the darkness. For long minutes I waited, wide awake, wondering what my next move should be. Finally deciding that I should again consult with the boys, I swung my legs over the edge of the bed, but immediately had to swing them back again as Big Ma re-entered the room. She passed the bed and pulled a straight-backed chair up to the window. Parting the curtains so that the blackness of the night mixed with the blackness of the room, she sat down without a sound. I heard the door to the boys' room open and close and I knew that Mama had gone in. I waited for the sound of the door opening again, but it did not come. Soon the chill of the cotton sheets beneath me began to fade and as Big Ma's presence lulled me into a security I did not really feel, I fell asleep. When I awoke, it was still nightly dark. ‘Big Ma!' I called. ‘Big Ma, you there!' But there was no reply from the chair by the window. Thinking that Big Ma had fallen asleep, I climbed from the bed and felt my way to her chair. She wasn't there. Outside, an owl hooted into the night, quiet now except for the drip-drap of water falling from the roof. I stood transfixed by the chair, afraid to move. Then I heard a noise on the porch. I could not control my trembling. Again the noise, this time close to the door, and it occurred to me that it was probably the boys coming to confer with me. No doubt Mama had left them alone too. Laughing silently at myself, I hurried onto the porch. 'Stacey,' I whispered. 'Christopher-John?' There was a sudden movement near the end of the porch and I headed to- ward it, feeling along the wall of the house. ‘Little Man! Hey, y'all, stop fooling 'round and answer me.' I crept precariously near the edge of the high porch, my eyes attempting to penetrate the blackness of the night. From below, a scratchy bristlyness sprang upon me, and I lost my balance and tumbled with a thud into the muddy flower bed. I lay paralyzed with fear. Then a long wet tongue licked my face. 'Jason ? Jason, that you!' Our hound dog whined his reply. I hugged him, then instantly let him go. ‘Was that you all the time! Look what you gone and done,' I fussed, thinking of the mess I was in with mud all over me. Jason whined again and I got up. I started to climb back up onto the porch but froze as a caravan of headlights appeared suddenly in the east, coming fast along the rain-soaked road like cat eyes in the night. Jason whined loudly, growing skittish as the lights approached, and when they slowed and braked before the house he slunk beneath the porch. I wanted to follow, but I couldn't. My legs would not move. The lead car swung into the muddy driveway and a shadowy figure outlined by the headlights of the car behind him stepped out. The man walked slowly up the drive. I stopped breathing. The driver of the next car got out, waiting. The first man stopped and stared at the house for several long moments as if uncertain whether it was the correct destination. Then he shook his head, and without a word returned to his car. With a wave of his hand he sent the other driver back in- side, and in less than a minute the lead car had backed into the road, its headlights facing the other cars. Each of the cars used the driveway to turn around, then the caravan sped away as swiftly as it had come, its seven pairs of rear lights glowing like distant red embers until they were swallowed from view by the Granger forest. Jason began barking now that the danger had passed, but he did not come out. As I reached for the porch to steady myself, there was a sense of quiet movement in the dark- ness. The moon slid from its dark covers, cloaking the earth in a shadowy white light, and I could see Mr. Morrison clearly, moving silently, like a jungle cat, from the side of the house to the road, a shotgun in his hand. Feeling sick, I crawled onto the porch and crept trembling toward the door. Once inside the house, I leaned against the latch while waves of sick terror swept over me. Realizing that I must get into bed before Mama or Big Ma came from the other room. I pulled off my muddy clothes, turning them inside out to wipe the mud from my body, and put on my night clothes. Then I climbed into the softness of the bed. I lay very still for a while, not allowing myself to think. But soon, against my will, the vision of ghostly headlights soaked into my mind and an uncontrollable trembling racked my body. And it remained until the dawn, when I fell into a restless sleep. Four 'Cassie, what's the matter with you, girl!' Big Ma asked as she thrust three sticks of dried pine into the stove to rekindle the dying morning fire. 'You sure are takin' a sorrowful long time to churn that butter. 'Nothin',' I muttered. 'Nothin' !' Big Ma turned and looked directly at me. ‘You been mopin' 'round here for the past week like you got the whoopin' cough, flu, and measles all put together. I sighed deeply and continued to churn. Big Ma reached out and felt my forehead, then my cheeks. Frowning, she pulled her hand away as Mama entered the kitchen. 'Mary, feel this child's face,' she said. ‘She seem warm to you !' Mama cupped my face in her thin hands. 'You feel sick, Cassie!' 'No'm.’ 'How do you feel?' 'All right,' I said, still churning. Mama studied me with the same disturbed look Big Ma wore and a tiny frown line appeared on her brow. 'Cassie, she said softly, fixing her dark eyes upon me, 'is there something you want to tell me!' I was on the verge of blurting out the awful truth about the bus and the men in the night, but then I remembered the pact Stacey had made us all swear to when I had told him, Christopher-John, and Little Man about the caravan and I said instead, 'No, ma'am,' and began to churn again. Abruptly, Mama took hold of the churning stick, her eyes searching mine. As she studied me, she seemed about to ask me something, then the question faded and she pulled away, lifting the lid of the churn .'It looks ready now,' she said with a sigh. 'Dip out the butter like I showed you and wash it down. I'll take care of the milk.' I scooped the butter from the churning lid onto a plate and went through the curtain to the small pantry off the kitchen to get the molding dish. It had been placed on a high shelf under several other dishes and I had to stand on a stool to get it. As I eased it out, Mama and Big Ma spoke softly in worried tones on the other side of the curtain. 'Somethin' the matter with that child, Mary. 'She's not sick, Mama.' 'There's all sorts of sickness. She ain't ate right for goin' on over a week. She ain't sleepin' right neither. Restless and murmurin' in her sleep all night long. And she won't hardly even go out and play, rather be in here helpin' us, Now you know that ain't like that child.' There was a moment's pause, then Mama whispered so I could hardly hear her. 'You think ... Mama, you think she could've seen - 'Oh, Lord, no, child,' Big Ma exclaimed hastily. 'I checked in there right after they passed and she was sound asleep. She couldn't've seen them old devils. The boys neither. Mama sighed. The boys, they're not themselves either. All of them, too quiet. Here it is Saturday morning and they're quiet as church mice. I don't like it, and I can't shake the feeling it's got something to do with – Cassie.' Without warning, I had lost my balance and with an absurd topple from the knee-high stool crashed upon the floor with the molding dish. 'Cassie, you hurt !' Mama asked, stooping beside me. 'No'm,' I mumbled, feeling very clumsy and close to tears. I knew that if I let the tears fall. Mama's suspicion that something was wrong would be confirmed for I never cried about such a silly thing as a fall; in fact, I seldom ever cried. So instead of crying, I jumped up quickly and began to pick up the broken pieces of the dish. 'I'm sorry, Mama,' I said. 'That's all right,' she said, helping me. When we had swept the chips away with the long field-straw broom, she told me, 'Leave the butter, Cassie, and go on in with the boys.' 'But, Mama…’ 'I'll do the butter. Now go on, do like I say. I stared up at Mama, wondering if she would ever know what we had done, then joined the boys who were sitting listlessly around the fire absently listening to T.J. 'See, fellows, there's a system to getting out of work,' T.J. was expounding as I sat down. 'Jus' don't be 'round when it's got to be done. Only thing is, you can't let your folks know that's what you're doin'. See, you should do like me. Like this mornin' when Mama wanted to bring back them scissors she borrowed from Miz Logan, I ups and volunteers so she don't have to make this long trip down here, she bein' so busy and all. And naturally when I got here, y'all wanted me to stay awhile and talk to y'all, so what could I do! I couldn't be impolite, could I! And by the time I finally convince y'all I gotta go, all the work'll be done at home.' T.J. chuckled with satisfaction. 'Yeah, you just have to use the old brain, that's all.' He was quiet a moment, expecting some comment on his discourse, but no one said a word. T.J.'s eyes roamed the length of the room, then he admonished, 'See, if you was smart like me, Stacey. you'd use the old brain to get the questions on that big test comin' up. Just think, they probably jus' sittin' right here in this very room waitin' to be discovered.' Stacey cast T.J. an annoyed look. but did not speak. 'Y'all sure are a sorry lot this mornin',' T.J. observed. 'A fellow's just wastin' his know-how talkin' to y'all.' 'Ain't nobody asked you to give it,' said Stacey. 'Well, you don't have to get snippety about it,' replied T.J. haughtily. Again. silence prevailed; but that would not do for T.J.'Say, how'bout we sneak down to that ole Wallace store and learn how to do them new dances!' 'Mama told us not to go down there,' Stacey said. 'You some mama's boy or somethin' you gotta do everything your mama tells - 'You go on if you wanna,' said Stacey quietly, not rising to T.J.'s bait, 'but we staying here.' Again, silence. 2Then T.J. said: 'Say, y'all hear the latest 'bout them night men!' Suddenly, all eyes turned from the fire and riveted themselves upon him. Our faces were eager question marks; we were totally in T.J.'s power. 'What 'bout them i' Stacey asked, almost evenly. T.J., of course, intended to nurse the moment for as long as he could. 'You see when a fellow's as smart as me, he gets to know things that other folks don't. Now, this kind of information ain't for the ears of little kids so I really shouldn't even tell y'all - 'Then don't!' said Stacey with smooth finality, turning back toward the fire as if he cared not at all about the night men. Taking his cue, I nudged Christopher-John and Christopher- John nudged Little Man, and the three of us forced ourselves to stare into the fire in feigned disinterest. Without a captive audience. T.J. had to reinterest us by getting to the point. 'Well, 'bout a week ago, they rode down to Mr. Sam Tatum's place - you know, down the Jackson Road toward Strawberry - and you know what they done !' Stacey, Little Man, and I kept our eyes upon the fire, but Christopher-John piped eagerly .'What?' I poked Christopher-John and he turned guiltily around, but T.J., triumphant with an assured audience of one, settled back in his chair ready to prolong the suspense. 'You know Mama'd kill me if she knowed I was tellin' this. I heard her and Miz Claire Thompson talkin' 'bout it. They was real scared. Don't know why though. Them ole night men sure wouldn't scare me none. Like I told Claude - 'Hey, y'all,' Stacey said, standing and motioning us up. 'Mama said she wanted us to take some milk and butter down to Miz Jackson before noon. We'd better get started.' I nodded, and Christopher-John, Little Man, and I got up. 'Tarred and feathered him!' T.J, announced hastily. 'Poured the blackest tar they could find all over him, then plastered him with chicken feathers.' T.J. laughed. 'Can you imagine that!' 'But why!' asked Little Man, forgetting our ploy. This time T.J. did not slow down. 'I dunno if y'all's little ears should hear this, but it seems ::e called Mr. Jim Lee Barnett a liar - he's the man who runs the Mercantile down in Strawberry. Mr. Tatum's s'pose to done told him that he ain't ordered up all them things Mr. Barnett done charged him for. Mr. Barnett said he had all them things Mr. Tatum ordered writ down and when Mr. Tatum asked to see that list of his, Mr. Barnett says, ""You callin' me a liar, boy!"" And Mr. Tatum says, ""Yessuh, I guess I is !"" That done it i' 'Then it wasn't 'cause of the bus!' Christopher-John blurted out. 'Bus ! What's a bus got to do with it !' 'Nothin',' said Stacey quickly. 'Nothin' at all.' 'Well, if anybody said them night men was down in here 'cause of some stupid bus, they crazy,' said T.J. authoritatively. ""Cause my information come direct from Miz Claire Thompson who seen Mr. Tatum herself.' 'You sure!' Stacey asked. 'Sure! Sure, I'm sure. When do I ever say anythin' when I ain't sure?' Stacey smiled with relief. 'Come on, let's get the milk.' All of us went into the kitchen, then to the bedrooms to get our coats. When we got outside. T.J. remembered that he had left his cap by the fire and ran back to retrieve it. As soon as we were alone. Little Man asked. 'Stacey, you really think them night men put tar and feathers all over Mr. Tatum!' 'I s'pose so,' said Stacey. Little Man frowned, but it was Christopher-John who spoke, whispering shrilly as if a stray morning ghost might overhear .'lf they ever find out 'bout the bus, you think they gonna put tar and feathers all over us !' Little Man's frown deepened and he observed gravely, 'If they did, we'd never get clean again. 'Cassie,' said Christopher-John, his eyes wide, 'w-was you real s-scared when you seen 'em !' Little Man shivered with excitement. ‘I wish I could've Seen 'em. 'Well, I don't,' declared Christopher-John. 'In fact, I wish I'd never heard of no night men or buses or secrets or holes in the road!' And with that outburst, he stuffed his pudgy hands into his thin jacket, pressed his lips firmly together, and refused to say another word. After a few moments, Stacey said, ‘What’s keeping T.J. !' The rest of us shrugged. then followed Stacey back up the porch into Mama's room. As we entered, T.J. jumped. He was standing at the desk with Mama's W.E.B, Du Bois's The Negro in his hands. 'That don't look like your cap.' said Stacey, 'Aw, man, I ain't done nothin'. jus' lookin' at Miz Logan's history book, that's all. I'm mighty interested in that place called Egypt she been tellin' us'bout and them black kings that was rulin' back then.' Still talking, he casually put down the book and picked up his cap. All four of us looked accusingly at T.J. and he halted. 'Say, what is this ! What's the meanin' of sneakin' up on me like that anyway! Y'all think I was lookin' for them test questions or somethin' ! Shoot, a fellow'd think you didn't trust him.' Then, thrusting his arm around Stacey's shoulders, he chided,'Friends gotta trust each other, Stacey, 'cause ain't nothin' like a true friend.' And with those words of wisdom he left the room, leaving us to wonder how he had managed to slink out of this one. The Monday after his arrival Mr. Morrison had moved into the deserted tenant shack that stood in the south pasture. It was a sorry mess, that house, Its door hung sadly from a broken hinge; its porch floorboards were rotted; and its one- room interior was densely occupied by rats, spiders, and other field creatures. But Mr. Morrison was a quiet man, almost shy, and although Mama had offered him lodging in our house, he preferred the old shack. Mama sensed that Mr. Morrison was a private person and she did not object to the move, but she did send the boys and me to the house to help clean it. Little Man, Christopher-John, and I took to Mr. Morrison immediately and had no objections to the cleaning. Any- body who was a friend of Papa's was all right in our book; besides, when he was near, night men and burnings and midnight tarrings faded into a hazy distance. But Stacey remained aloof and had little to do with him. After the cleaning I asked Mama if Christopher-John, Little Man, and I could go visit Mr. Morrison, but she said no. 'But, Mama, I wanna know more 'bout him,' I explained. 'I just wanna know how come he's so big. 'You know about as much as you need to know.' she decided. 'And long as Mr. Morrison stays here, that's his house. If he wants you down there, he'll ask you. 'Don't know how come y'all wanna go down there no- way,' Stacey said moodily when Mama was out of hearing. ""Cause we like him, that's why.' I answered, tired of his distant attitude toward Mr. Morrison. Then, as discreetly as I could, I said. 'What's the matter with you, boy, not liking Mr. Morrison!' Stacey shrugged. 'I like him all right.' 'Don't act that way.’ Stacey looked away from me. 'Don't need him here. All that work he doing, I could've done it myself. Ah, you couldn't've done no such thing. Besides - I looked around to be certain that Big Ma and Mama were not near - 'besides, Papa didn't just bring him here to do no work. You know how come he really here.' Stacey turned toward me haughtily. 'I could've taken care of that too.' I rolled my eyes at him, but held my peace. I didn't feel like a fight, and as long as Mr. Morrison was within hollering distance of the back porch, it made little difference to me what Stacey thought he could do. 'I sure wouldn't want that big ole man stayin' at my place.' said T.J. on the way to school. 'I betcha he get mad one time, he'd take ole Little Man and swing him over that tree yonder like he wasn't nothin' but a twig.' He laughed then as Little Man set his lips and stared angrily up. 'Course, I could probably 'bout do that myself. 'Couldn't neither !' denied Little Man. 'Hush, Man,' said Stacey.' T.J., leave Man alone.' 'Aw, I ain't botherin' him. Little Man's my buddy, ain't ya, Man ?' Little Man scowled, but didn't reply. T.J. turned back to Stacey. 'You ready for that history test?' 'Hope so,' said Stacey.'But I keep forgetting them dates.' 'Betcha I could help ya, if you be nice.' 'How? You worse than I am'bout dates.' T.J. grinned, then slyly pulled a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and handed it to Stacey. Stacey unfolded it, looked at it curiously, then frowned. 'You planning on cheating !' 'Well, naw, I ain't plannin' on it,' said T.J. seriously. 'Jus' if I gotta.' 'Well, you ain't gonna,' said Stacey, tearing the paper in two. 'Hey, what's the matter with you, man !' cried T.J. grabbing for the paper. But Stacey turned his back to him and tore the paper into bits, then deposited them in the gully. 'Man, that she' ain't right ! I wouldn't do you that way !' 'Maybe not.' replied Stacey, 'But at least this way you won't get into no trouble.' T.J. mumbled, 'If failin' ain't trouble, I don't know what Little Man, Christopher-John, Claude, and I were sitting on the bottom step of the seventh-gradeclass building after school waiting for Stacey and T.J. when the front door banged open and T.J. shot out and tore across the yard. 'What's the matter with him!' asked Christopher-John, 'Ain't he gonna wait for Stacey!' The rest of the seventh grade, led by Little Willie Wiggins and Moe Turner, spilled from the building. 'There he go!' cried Little Willie as T.J. disappeared on the forest road. Moe Turner yelled, 'Let's see where he goin' !' Then he and three other boys dashed away in pursuit of T.J. But the others stood restlessly near the steps as if school had not yet ended. 'Hey, what's going on?' I asked Little Willie, 'What's everybody waiting' round for?' 'And where's Stacey!' demanded Little Man. Little Willie smiled. 'Stacey inside with Miz Logan. He got whipped today. 'Whipped!' I cried. 'Why, can't nobody whip Stacey. Who done it!' Your mama,' laughed Little Willie. 'Mama !' Christopher-John, Little Man, and I exclaimed. Little Willie nodded. 'Yep. In front of everybody. I swallowed hard, feeling very sorry for my older brother. It was bad enough to be whipped in front of thirty others by a teacher, but to get it by one's own mother - now that was downright embarrassing. 'Why'd Mama do that !' asked Christopher-John. 'She caught him with cheat notes during the history examination.' 'Mama knows Stacey wouldn't cheat!' I declared. Little Willie shrugged. 'Well, whether she knowed it or not, she sho''nough whipped him... Course, now, she give him a chance to get out of it when he said he wasn't cheatin' and she asked him how he got them cheat notes. But Stacey wouldn't tell on ole T.J., and you know good and well ole T.J. wasn't 'bout to say them notes was his.' 'Cheat notes ! But how'd T.J. get cheat notes! Stacey got rid of them things this morning !' 'Come noontime though,' replied Little Willie,'T.J. was in them woods busy writing himself another set. Me and Moe seen him.' 'Well, what the devil was Stacey doing with 'em!' 'Well, we was in the middle of the examination and ole T.J. slips out these cheat notes - me and Clarence here was sittin' right behind him and T.J. and seen the whole thing. Stacey was sittin' right side of T.J. and when he seen them notes, he motioned T.J. to put 'em away. At first T.J. wouldn't do it, but then he seen Miz Logan startin' toward em and he slipped Stacey the notes. Well, Stacey didn't see Miz Logan comin' when he took them notes, and by the time he saw her it was too late to get rid of 'em. Wasn't nothin' Miz Logan could do but whip him. Failed him too.' 'And ole T.J. just sat there and ain't said a word,' interjected Clarence, laughing. 'But knowin' Stacey, I betcha ole T.J, ain't gonna get away with it,' chuckled Little Willie.'And T.J. know it too. That's why he lit outa here like he done, and I betcha - Hey, Stacey !' Everyone turned as Stacey bounded down the steps. His square face was unsmiling, but there was no anger in his voice when he asked quietly, 'Anybody seen T.J.!' All the students answered at once, indicating that T.J. had headed west toward home, then surrounded Stacey as he started across the lawn. Christopher-John, Little Man, Claude, and I followed. When we reached the crossroads, Moe Turner was waiting. T.J. went down to the Wallace store,' he announced. Stacey stopped and so did everyone else. Stacey stared past Jefferson Davis, then back down the road toward Great Faith. Looking over his shoulder, he found me and ordered, 'Cassie, you and Christopher-John and Man go on home.' 'You come too,' I said, afraid of where he was going. 2'Got something to take care of first,' he said, walking away. 'Mama gonna take care of you, too !' I hollered after him. ""You know she said we wasn't to go down there, and she find out, she gonna wear you out again! Papa too!' But Stacey did not come back. For a moment, Little Man, Christopher-John, Claude, and I stood watching Stacey and the others heading swiftly northward. Then Little Man said, 'I wanna see what he gonna do.' 'I don't,' declared Christopher-John. 'Come on,' I said, starting after Stacey with Little Man and Claude beside me. 'I don't want no whipping!' objected Christopher-John. standing alone in the crossroads. But when he saw that we were not coming back, he puffed to join us, grumbling all the while. The Wallace store stood almost a half mile beyond Jefferson Davis, on a triangular lot that faced the Soldiers Bridge crossroads. Once the Granger plantation store, it had been run by the Wallaces for as long as I could remember, and most of the people within the forty-mile stretch between Smellings Creek and Strawberry shopped there. The other three corners of the crossroads were forest land, black and dense. The store consisted of a small building with a gas pump in front and a storage house in back. Beyond the store, against the forest edge, were two gray clapboard houses and a small garden. But there were no fields; the Wallaces did not farm. Stacey and the other students were standing in the door- way of the store when Little Man, Christopher-John, Claude, and I ran up. We squeezed through so we could see inside. A man we all knew was Kaleb Wallace stood behind the counter. A few other men sat around a stove playing checkers, and Jeremy's older brothers, R.W. and Melvin, who had dropped out of school long ago, leaned sleepy- eyed against the counter staring at us. 'Y'all go on to the back.' said Kaleb Wallace, 'lessn y'all wanna buy something. Mr. Dewberry got the music goin' already. As we turned away from the entrance, Melvin Simms said, 'Just look at all the little niggers come to dance,' and the laughter of the men filled the room. Christopher-John tugged at my arm. 'I don't like this place. Cassie. Let's go on home.' 'We can't leave without Stacey,' I said. Music beckoned from the storage room where Dewberry Wallace was placing round brown bottles on a small table as we crowded in. Aside from the table, there was no furniture in the room. Boxes lined the walls and the center floor had been cleared for dancing - several older couples from Great Faith were already engaged in movements I had never seen before. 'What they doing?' asked Little Man. I shrugged. 'I guess that's what they call dancing. There he go!' someone shouted as the back door of the storeroom slammed shut. Stacey turned quickly and sped to the back of the building. T.J. was fleeing straight toward Soldiers Road. Stacey tore across the Wallace yard and, leaping high like a forest fox, fell upon T.J., knocking him down. The two boys rolled toward the road, each trying to keep the other's back pinned to the ground, but then Stacey, who was stronger, gained the advantage and T.J., finding that he could not budge him, cried, 'Hey, wait a minute, man, let me explain - Stacey did not let him finish. Jumping up, he pulled T.J. up too and hit him squarely in the face. T.J. staggered back holding his eyes as if he were badly hurt, and Stacey momentarily let down his guard. At that moment, T.J. rammed into Stacey, forcing the fight to the ground again. Little Man, Christopher-John, and I, with the others, circled the fighters, chanting loudly as they rolled back and forth punching at each other. All of us were so engrossed in the battle that no one saw a mule wagon halt on the road and a giant man step out. It wasn't until I realized that the shouting had stopped behind us and that the girls and boys beside me were falling back that I looked up. Mr. Morrison towered above us. He did not look at me or Christopher-John or Little Man, although I knew he had seen us, but walked straight to the fighters and lifted a still-swinging Stacey off T,J. After a long, tense moment, he said to Stacey, 'You and your sister and brothers get on in the wagon.' We walked through the now-silent crowd. Kaleb and Dewbeny Wallace, standing on the front porch of the store with the Simmses, stared at Mr. Morrison as we passed, but Mr. Morrison looked through them as if they were not there. Stacey sat in front of the wagon with Mr. Morrison; the rest of us climbed into the back. 'Now we gonna get it,' shuddered ChristopherJohn. 'I told y'all we shoulda gone on home.' Before Mr. Morrison took the reins, he handed Stacey a handkerchief in which to wrap his bruised right hand, but he did not say a word and it wasn't until we had passed the crossroads leading to Great Faith that the silence was broken. 'Mr. Morrison ... you gonna tell Mama!' Stacey asked huskily. Mr. Morrison was very quiet as Jack the mule clopped noisily along the dry road. 'Seems I heard your mama tell y'all not to go up to that Wallace store,' he said at last. 'Y-yessir,' said Stacey, glancing nervously at Mr. Morrison. Then he blurted out,'But I had good reason I' 'Ain't never reason good enough to go disobey your mama.' The boys and I looked woefully at each other and my bottom stung from the awful thought of Mama's leather strap against it. 'But Mr. Morrison,' I cried anxiously, T.J. was hiding there 'cause he thought Stacey wouldn't never come down there to get him. But Stacey had to go down there 'cause T.J. was cheating and - 'Hush, Cassie,' Stacey ordered, turning sharply around. 2I faltered for only a moment before deciding that my bottom was more important than Stacey's code of honor - and Stacey had to take the blame for it and Mama whipped him right in front of God and everybody?' Once the truth had been disclosed, I waited with dry throat and nauseous stomach for Mr. Morrison to say something. When he did, all of us strained tensely forward, 'I ain't gonna tell her,' he said quietly. Christopher-John sighed with relief. 'Ain't going down there no more neither,' he promised. Little Man and I agreed. But Stacey stared long and hard at Mr. Morrison. 'How come, Mr. Morrison!' he asked. 'How come you ain't gonna tell Mama!' Mr. Morrison slowed Jack as we turned into the road leading home. ""Cause I'm leaving it up to you to tell her. 'What !' we exclaimed together. 'Sometimes a person's gotta fight.' he said slowly. ‘But that store ain't the place to be doing it. From what I hear, folks like them Wallaces got no respect at all for colored folks and they just think it's funny when we fight each other. Your mama knowed them Wallaces ain't good folks, that's why she don't want y'all down there, and y'all owe it to her and y'allselves to tell her. But I'm gonna leave it up to y'all to decide.' Stacey nodded thoughtfully and wound his handkerchief tighter around his wounded hand. His face was not scarred, so if he could just figure out a way to explain the bruises on his hand to Mama without lying he was in the clear, for Mr. Morrison had not said that he had to tell her. But for some reason I could not understand he said, 'All right, Mr. Morrison, I'll tell her."" 'Boy, you crazy!' I cried as Christopher-John and Little Man speedily came to the same conclusion. If he did not care about his own skin, he could at least consider ours. But he seemed not to hear us as his eyes met Mr. Morrison’s and the two of them smiled in subtle understanding, the distance between them fading, As we neared the house, Mr. Granger's Packard rolled from the dusty driveway. Mr. Morrison directed Jack to the side of the road until the big car had passed, then swung the wagon back into the road's center and up the drive. Big Ma was standing by the yard gate that led onto the drive, gazing across the road at the forest. 'Big Ma. what was Mr. Granger doing here!' Stacey asked, jumping from the wagon and going to her. Little Man, Christopher-John. and I hopped down and followed him. 'Nothin',' Big Ma replied absently, her eyes still on the forest. 'Just worryin' me 'bout this land again.' 'Oh,' said Stacey, his tone indicating that he considered the visit of no importance. Mr. Granger had always wanted the land. He turned and went to help Mr. Morrison. Little Man and Christopher-John went with him, but I remained by the gate with Big Ma. 'Big Ma.' I said, 'what Mr. Granger need more land for!' 'Don't need it,' Big Ma said flatly, 'Got more land now than he know what to do with. 'Well, what he want with ours then!' 'Just like to have it, that's all. 'Well, seems to me he's just being greedy. You ain't gonna sell it to him, are you!' Big Ma did not answer me. Instead, she pushed open the gate and walked down the drive and across the road into the forest. I ran after her. We walked in silence down the narrow cow path which wound through the old forest to the pond. As we neared the pond, the forest gaped open into a wide, brown glade, man-made by the felling of many trees, some of them still on the ground. They had been cut during the summer after Mr. Andersen came from Strawberry with an offer to buy the trees. The offer was backed with a threat, and Big Ma was afraid. So Andersen's lumbermen came, chopping and sawing, destroying the fine old trees. Papa was away on the railroad then but Mama sent Stacey for him. He returned and stopped the cutting, but not before many of the trees had already fallen. Big Ma surveyed the clearing without a word, then, step ping around the rotting trees, she made her way to the pond and sat down on one of them. I sat close beside her and waited for her to speak. After a while she shook her head and said: 'I'm she' glad your grandpa never had to see none of this. He dearly loved these here old trees. Him and me, we used to come down here early mornin's or just 'fore the sun was 'bout to set and just sit and talk. He used to call this place his thinkin' spot and he called that old pond there Caroline, after me.' She smiled vaguely, but not at me. 'You know, I ... I wasn't hardly eighteen when Paul Ed- ward married me and brung me here. He was older than me by 'bout eight years and he was smart. Ow-ow, my Lord, that was one smart man ! He had himself a mind like a steel trap. Anything he seen done, he could do it. He had done learned carpentry back up there near Macon, Georgia, where he was born. Born into slavery he was, two years 'fore freedom come, and him and his mama stayed on at that plantation after the fightin' was finished. But then when he got to be fourteen and his mama died, he left that place and worked his way 'cross here up to Vicksburg. That's where he met you, ain't it, Big Ma!' I asked, al- ready knowing the answer. Big Ma nodded, smiling. 'Sho' was. He was carpenterin' up there and my papa took me in with him to Vicksburg - we was tenant farmin' 'bout thirty miles from there - to see 'bout gettin' a store-bought rocker for my mama, and there was ole Paul Edward workin' in that furniture shop just as big. Had himself a good job, but that ole job wasn't what he wanted. He wanted himself some land. Kept on and kept on talkin' 'bout land, and then this place come up for sell. 'And he bought himself two hundred acres from that Yankee, didn't he!'"
69,“The People Could Fly.”,"Hamilton, Virginia",b078_ThePeopleCouldFly.txt,4,"They say the people could fly. Say that long ago in Africa, some of the people knew magic. And they would walk up on the air like climbin’ up on a gate. And they flew like blackbirds over the fields. Black, shiny wings flappin’ against the blue up there. Then, many of the people were captured for Slavery. The ones that could fly shed their wings. They couldn’t take their wings across the water on the slave ships. Too crowded, don’t you know. The folks were full of misery, then. Got sick with the up and down of the sea. So they forgot about flyin’ when they could no longer breathe the sweet scent of Africa. Say the people who could fly kept their power, although they shed their wings. They kept their secret magic in the land of slavery. They looked the same as the other people from Africa who had been coming over, who had dark skin. Say you couldn’t tell anymore one who could fly from one who couldn’t. One such who could was an old man, call him Toby. And standin’ tall, yet afraid, was a young woman who once had wings. Call her Sarah. Now Sarah carried a babe tied to her back. She trembled to be so hard worked and scorned. The slaves labored in the fields from sunup to sundown. The owner of the slaves callin’ himself their Master. Say he was a hard lump of clay. A hard, glinty coal. A hard rock pile, wouldn’t be moved. His Overseer1 on horseback pointed out the slaves who were slowin’ down. So the one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to. Sarah hoed and chopped the row as the babe on her back slept. Say the child grew hungry. That babe started up bawling too loud. Sarah couldn’t stop to feed it. Couldn’t stop to soothe and quiet it down. She let it cry. She didn’t want to. She had no heart to croon to it. “Keep that thing quiet,” called the Overseer. He pointed his finger at the babe. The woman scrunched low. The Driver cracked his whip across the babe anyhow. The babe hollered like any hurt child, and the woman fell to the earth. The old man that was there, Toby, came and helped her to her feet. “I must go soon,” she told him. “Soon,” he said. Sarah couldn’t stand up straight any longer. She was too weak. The sun burned her face. The babe cried and cried, “Pity me, oh, pity me,” say it sounded like. Sarah was so sad and starvin’, she sat down in the row. “Get up, you black cow,” called the Overseer. He pointed his hand, and the Driver’s whip snarled around Sarah’s legs. Her sack dress tore into rags. Her legs bled onto the earth. She couldn’t get up. Toby was there where there was no one to help her and the babe. “Now, before it’s too late,” panted Sarah. “Now, Father!” “Yes, Daughter, the time is come,” Toby answered. “Go, as you know how to go!” He raised his arms, holding them out to her. And more magic words, said so quickly, they sounded like whispers and sighs. The young woman lifted one foot on the air. Then the other. She flew clumsily at first, with the child now held tightly in her arms. Then she felt the magic, the African mystery. Say she rose just as free as a bird. As light as a feather. The Overseer rode after her, hollerin’. Sarah flew over the fences. She flew over the woods. Tall trees could not snag her. Nor could the Overseer. She flew like an eagle now, until she was gone from sight. No one dared speak about it. Couldn’t believe it. But it was, because they that was there saw that it was. Say the next day was dead hot in the fields. A young man slave fell from the heat. The Driver come and whipped him. Toby come over and spoke words to the fallen one. The words of ancient Africa once heard are never remembered completely. The young man forgot them as soon as he heard them. They went way inside him. He got up and rolled over on the air. He rode it awhile. And he flew away. Another and another fell from the heat. Toby was there. He cried out to the fallen and reached his arms out to them. “Kum kunka yali, kum . . . tambe!” Whispers and sighs. And they too rose on the air. They rode the hot breezes. The ones flyin’ were black and shinin’ sticks, wheelin’ above the head of the Overseer. They crossed the rows, the fields, the fences, the streams, and were away. “Seize the old man!” cried the Overseer. “I heard him say the magic words. Seize him!” The one callin’ himself Master come runnin’. The Driver got his whip ready to curl around old Toby and tie him up. The slave owner took his hip gun from its place. He meant to kill old black Toby. But Toby just laughed. Say he threw back his head and said, “Hee, hee! Don’t you know who I am? Don’t you know some of us in this field?” He said it to their faces. “We are ones who fly!” And he sighed the ancient words that were a dark promise. He said them all around to the others in the field under the whip, “. . . buba yali . . . buba tambe . . .” There was a great outcryin’. The bent backs straighted up. Old and young who were called slaves and could fly joined hands. Say like they would ring-sing. But they didn’t shuffle in a circle. They didn’t sing. They rose on the air. They flew in a flock that was black against the heavenly blue. Black crows or black shadows. It didn’t matter, they went so high. Way above the plantation, way over the slavery land. Say they flew away to Free-dom. And the old man, old Toby, flew behind them, takin’ care of them. He wasn’t cryin’. He wasn’t laughin’. He was the seer. His gaze fell on the plantation where the slaves who could not fly waited. “Take us with you!” Their looks spoke it, but they were afraid to shout it. Toby couldn’t take them with him. Hadn’t the time to teach them to fly. They must wait for a chance to run. “Goodie-bye!” the old man called Toby spoke to them, poor souls! And he was flyin’ gone. So they say. The Overseer told it. The one called Master said it was a lie, a trick of the light. The Driver kept his mouth shut. The slaves who could not fly told about the people who could fly to their children. When they were free. When they sat close before the fire in the free land, they told it. They did so love firelight and Free-dom, and tellin’. They say that the children of the ones who could not fly told their children. And now, me, I have told it to you."
70,The Tale of the Mandarin Ducks,"Paterson, Katherine",b079_TheTaleoftheMandarinDucks.txt,4,"Long ago and far away in the Land of the Rising Sun, there lived together a pair of mandarin ducks. Now, the drake was a magnificent bird with plumage of colors so rich that the emperor himself would have envied it. But his mate, the duck, wore the quiet tones of the wood, blending exactly with the hole in the tree where the two had made their nest. One day while the duck was sitting on her eggs, the drake flew down to a nearby pond to search for food. While he was there, a hunting party entered the woods. The hunters were led by the lord of the district, a proud and cruel man who believed that everything in the district belonged to him to do with as he chose. The lord was always looking for beautiful things to adorn his manor house and garden. And when he saw the drake swimming gracefully on the surface of the pond, he determined to capture him. The lord’s chief steward, a man named Shozo, tried to discourage his master. “The drake is a wild spirit, my lord,” he said. “Surely he will die in captivity.” But the lord pretended not to hear Shozo. Secretly he despised Shozo, because although Shozo had once been his mightiest samurai, the warrior had lost an eye in battle and was no longer handsome to look upon. The lord ordered his servants to clear a narrow way through the undergrowth and place acorns along the path. When the drake came out of the water he saw the acorns. How pleased he was! He forgot to be cautious, thinking only of what a feast they would be to take home to his mate. Just as he was bending to pick up an acorn in his scarlet beak, a net fell over him, and the frightened bird was carried back to the lord’s manor and placed in a small bamboo cage."
71,“Eleven.”,"Cisneros, Sandra",b080_Eleven.txt,4,"What they don’t understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you’re eleven, you’re also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two, and one. And when you wake up on your eleventh birthday you expect to feel eleven, but you don’t. You open your eyes and everything’s just like yesterday, only it’s today. And you don’t feel eleven at all. You feel like you’re still ten. And you are—underneath the year that makes you eleven. Like some days you might say something stupid, and that’s the part of you that’s still ten. Or maybe some days you might need to sit on your mama’s lap because you’re scared, and that’s the part of you that’s five. And maybe one day when you’re all grown up maybe you will need to cry like if you’re three, and that’s okay. That’s what I tell Mama when she’s sad and needs to cry. Maybe she’s feeling three. Because the way you grow old is kind of like an onion or like the rings inside a tree trunk or like my little wooden dolls that fit one inside the other, each year inside the next one. That’s how being eleven years old is. You don’t feel eleven. Not right away. It takes a few days, weeks even, sometimes even months before you say Eleven when they ask you. And you don’t feel smart eleven, not until you’re almost twelve. That’s the way it is. Only today I wish I didn’t have only eleven years rattling inside me like pennies in a tin Band-Aid box. Today I wish I was one hundred and two instead of eleven because if I was one hundred and two I’d have known what to say when Mrs. Price put the red sweater on my desk. I would’ve known how to tell her it wasn’t mine instead of just sitting there with that look on my face and nothing coming out of my mouth. “Whose is this?” Mrs. Price says, and she holds the red sweater up in the air for all the class to see. “Whose? It’s been sitting in the coatroom for a month.” “Not mine,” says everybody. “Not me.” “It has to belong to somebody,” Mrs. Price keeps saying, but nobody can remember. It’s an ugly sweater with red plastic buttons and a collar and sleeves all stretched out like you could use it for a jump rope. It’s maybe a thousand years old and even if it belonged to me I wouldn’t say so. Maybe because I’m skinny, maybe because she doesn’t like me, that stupid Sylvia Saldivar says, “I think it belongs to Rachel.” An ugly sweater like that all raggedy and old, but Mrs. Price believes her. Mrs. Price takes the sweater and puts it right on my desk, but when I open my mouth nothing comes out. “That’s not, I don’t, you’re not…Not mine.” I finally say in a little voice that was maybe me when I was four. “Of course it’s yours,” Mrs. Price says. “I remember you wearing it once.” Because she’s older and the teacher, she’s right and I’m not. Not mine, not mine, not mine, but Mrs. Price is already turning to page thirty -two, and math problem number four. I don’t know why but all of a sudden I’m feeling sick inside, like the part of me that’s three wants to come out of my eyes, only I squeeze them shut tight and bite down on my teeth real hard and try to remember today I am eleven, eleven. Mama is making a cake for me for tonight, and when Papa comes home everybody will sing Happy birthday, happy birthday to you. But when the sick feeling goes away and I open my eyes, the red sweater’s still sitting there like a big red mountain. I move the red sweater to the corner of my desk with my ruler. I move my pencil and books and eraser as far from it as possible. I even move my chair a little to the right. Not mine, not mine, not mine. In my head I’m thinking how long till lunchtime, how long till I can take the red sweater and throw it over the schoolyard fence, or leave it hanging on a parking meter, or bunch it up into a little ball and toss it in the alley. Except when math period ends Mrs. Price says loud and in front of everybody, “Now, Rachel, that’s enough,” because she sees I’ve shoved the red sweater to the tippy -tip corner of my desk and it’s hanging all over the edge like a waterfall, but I don’t care. “Rachel,” Mrs. Price says. She says it like she’s getting mad. “You put that sweater on right now and no more nonsense.” “But it’s not – “ “Now!” Mrs. Price says This is when I wish I wasn’t eleven because all the years inside of me —ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one —are pushing at the back of my eyes when I put one arm through one sleeve of the sweater that smells like cottage cheese, and then the other arm through the other and stand there with my arms apart like if the sweater hurts me and it does, all itchy and full of germs that aren’t even mine. That’s when everything I’ve been holding in since this morning, since when Mrs. Price put the sweater on my desk, finally lets go, and all of a sudden I’m crying in front of everybody. I wish I was invisible but I’m not. I’m eleven and it’s my birthday today and I’m crying like I’m three in front of everybody. I put my head down on the desk and bury my face in my stupid clown -sweater arms. My face all hot and spit coming out of my mouth because I can’t stop the little animal noises from coming out of me until there aren’t any more tears left in my eyes, and it’s just my body shaking like when you have the hiccups, and my whole head hurts like when you drink milk too fast. But the worst part is right before the bell rings for lunch. That stupid Phyllis Lopez, who is even dumber than Sylvia Saldivar, says she remembers the red sweater is hers. I take it off right away and give it to her, only Mrs. Price pretends like everything’s okay. Today I’m eleven. There’s a cake Mama’s making for tonight and when Papa comes home from work we’ll eat it. There’ll be candles and presents and everybody will sing Happy birthday, happy birthday to you, Rachel, only it’s too late. I’m eleven today. I’m eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one, but I wish I was one hundred and two. I wish I was anything but eleven. Because I want today to be far away already, far away like a runaway balloon, like a tiny o in the sky, so tiny —tiny you have to close your eyes to see it."
72,Black Ships Before Troy: The Story of the Iliad,"Sutcliff, Rosemary",b081_BlackShipsBeforeTroy.txt,4,"In the high and far-off days when men were heroes and walked with the gods, Peleus, king of the Myrmidons, took for his wife a sea nymph called Thetis, Thetis of the Silver Feet. Many guests came to their wedding feast, and among the mortal guests came all the gods of high Olympus. But as they sat feasting, one who had not been invited was suddenly in their midst: Eris, the goddess of discord, had been left out because wherever she went she took trouble with her; yet here she was, all the same, and in her blackest mood, to avenge the insult. All she did—it seemed a small thing—was to toss down on the table a golden apple. Then she breathed upon the guests once, and vanished. The apple lay gleaming among the piled fruits and the brimming wine cups; and bending close to look at it, everyone could see the words “To the fairest” traced on its side. Then the three greatest of the goddesses each claimed that it was hers. Hera claimed it as wife to Zeus, the All-father, and queen of all the gods. Athene claimed that she had the better right, for the beauty of wisdom such as hers surpassed all else. Aphrodite only smiled, and asked who had a better claim to beauty’s prize than the goddess of beauty herself. They fell to arguing among themselves; the argument became a quarrel, and the quarrel grew more and more bitter, and each called upon the assembled guests to judge between them. But the other guests refused, for they knew well enough that, whichever goddess they chose to receive the golden apple, they would make enemies of the other two."
73,“Letter on Thomas Jefferson.”,"Adams, John",b082_LetteronThomasJefferson.txt,4,"Your favour of the 2d instant has prescribed a dismal plan, which I was never very well calculated to execute, but am now wholly incapable. I can write nothing which will not be suspected of personal vanity, local prejudice or Provincial & State partiality. However, as I hold myself responsible, at this age, to one only tribunal in the Universe, I will give you a few hints at all hazards.
As Mr: Hancock was sick and confined Mr Bowdoin was chosen at the head of the Massachusetts delegation to Congress. His relations thought his great fortune ought not to be hazarded. Cushing, too Adams’s and Paine, all destitute of fortune; four poor Pilgrims, proceeded in one Coach; were escorted through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey into Pennsylvania. We were met at Frankfort by Dr Rush, Mr Mifflin, Mr Bayard and several others of the most active Sons of Liberty, in Philadelphia, who desired a conference with us. We invited them to take Tea with us in a private apartment. They asked leave to give us some information and advice, which we thankfully granted. They represented to us that the friends of Government in Boston and in the Eastern States, in their correspondence with their friends in Pennsylvania and all the Southern States, had represented us as four desperate adventurers. Mr Cushing was a harmless kind of man, but poor and wholly dependent upon his popularity for his subsistence. Mr Samuel Adams was a very artful designing man, but desperately poor and wholly dependent on his popularity with the lowest vulgar for his living. John Adams and Mr Paine were two young Lawyers of no great talents reputation or weight, who had no other means of raising themselves into consequence but by courting popularity. We were all suspected of having Independence in view. Now, said they, you must not utter the word Independence, nor give the least hint or insinuation of the idea, neither in Congress or any private conversation; if you do you are undone; for the idea of Independence is as unpopular in Pennsylvania and in all the middle and Southern States as the Stamp Act itself. No Man dares to speak of it. Moreover, you are the Representatives of the suffering State. Boston and Massachusetts are under a rod of Iron. British fleets and Armies are tyranizing over you; you yourselves are personally obnoxious to them and all the friends of government.
You have been long persecuted by them all:—Your feelings have been hurt; your passions excited; you are thought to be too warm, too zealous, too sanguine, you must be therefore very cautious. You must not come forward with any bold measures; you must not pretend to take the lead. You know Virginia is the most populous State in the Union. They are very proud of their antient Dominion, as they call it; they think they have a right to take the lead, and the Southern States and middle States too, are too much disposed to yield it to them. This was plain dealing, Mr Pickering, and I must confess, that there appeared so much wisdom and good sense in it, that it made a deep impression on my mind, and it had an equal effect on all my Colleagues. This conversation and the principles facts and motives suggested in it, have given a colour complection and character to the whole policy of the United States, from that day to this. Without it, Mr: Washington would never have commanded our armies, nor Mr: Jefferson have been the Author of the declaration of Independence, nor Mr: Richard Henry Lee the mover of it; nor Mr: Chase the mover of foreign connections.
If I have ever had cause to repent of any part of this policy, that repentance ever has been and ever will be unavailing. I had forgot to say; nor had Mr: Johnston ever have been the nominator of Washington for General.
Although this advice dwelt deeply on my mind, I had not in my nature prudence & caution enough always to observe it. When I found the members of Congress, Virginians & all, so perfectly convinced that they should be able to perswade or terrify Great Britain into a relinquishment of her policy, and a restoration of us to the State of 1763, I was astonished, and could not help muttering in Congress and sometimes out of doors, that they would find, that the proud domineering spirit of Great Britain; their vain conceit of their own Omnipotence; their total contempt of us, and the incessant representations of their friends and instruments in America, would drive us to extremities and finally conquer us; transport us to England for trial, there to be hanged, drawn and quartered for Treason, or to the necessity of declaring Independence, however hazardous and uncertain such a desperate measure might be.
It soon became rumoured about the City that John Adams was for Independence; the Quakers & Proprietary Gentlemen, took the alarm; represented me as the worst of men, the true-blue Sons of Liberty pitied me; all put me under a kind of Coventry. I was avoided like a man infected with the Leprosy. I walked the streets of Philadelphia in solitude, born down by the weight of care and unpopularity. But every ship for the ensuing year, brought us fresh proof of the truth of my prophesies and one after another became convinced of the necessity of Independence. I did not sink under my discouragements; I had before experienced enough of the Wantonness of popularity in the trial of Preston and the Soldiers, in Boston.
You enquire why so young a man as Jefferson was placed at the head of the Committee for preparing a declaration of Independence? I answer, it was the Frankfort advice, to place Virginia at the head of everything. Mr: Richard Henry Lee, might be gone to Virginia, to his sick family, for aught I know, but that was not the reason of Mr: Jefferson’s appointment. There were three Committees appointed at the same time. One for the declaration of Independence; another for preparing Articles of Confederation; and another for preparing a Treaty to be proposed to France. Mr Lee was chosen for the Committee of confederation, and it was not thought convenient that the same person should be upon both. Mr Jefferson came into Congress in June 1775. and brought with him a reputation for literature, science, and a happy talent at composition. Writings of his were handed about remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression. Though a silent member in Congress, he was so prompt, frank, explicit and decisive upon Committees, not even Saml Adams was more so, that he soon seized upon my heart, and upon this occasion I gave him my vote and did all in my power to procure the votes of others. I think he had one more vote than any other, and that placed him at the head of the Committee. I had the next highest number and that placed me the second. The Committee met, discussed the subject, and then appointed Mr: Jefferson & me to make the draught; I suppose, because we were the two highest on the list. The Sub-Committee met; Jefferson proposed to me to make the draught. I said I will not; You shall do it. Oh No! Why will you not? You ought to do it. I will not. Why? Reasons enough. What can be your reasons? Reason 1st. You are a Virginian, and Virginia ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason 2d. I am obnoxious, suspected and unpopular; You are very much otherwise. Reason 3d: You can write ten times better than I can. “Well,” said Jefferson, “if you are decided I will do as well as I can.” Very well, when you have drawn it up we will have a meeting. A meeting we accordingly had and conn’d the paper over. I was delighted with its high tone, and the flights of Oratory with which it abounded, especially that concerning Negro Slavery, which though I knew his Southern Bretheren would never suffer to pass in Congress, I certainly never would oppose. There were other expressions, which I would not have inserted if I had drawn it up; particularly that which called the King a Tyrant. I thought this too personal, for I never believed George to be a tyrant in disposition and in nature; I always believed him to be deceived by his Courtiers on both sides the Atlantic, and in his Official capacity only, Cruel.
I thought the expression too passionate and too much like scolding for so grave and solemn a document; but as Franklin and Sherman were to inspect it afterwards, I thought it would not become me to strike it out. I consented to report it and do not now remember that I made or suggested a single alteration. We reported it to the Committee of Five. It was read and I do not remember that Franklin or Sherman criticized any thing. We were all in haste; Congress was impatient and the Instrument was reported, as I believe in Jefferson’s hand writing as he first drew it. Congress cut off about a quarter part of it, as I expected they would, but they obliterated some of the best of it and left all that was exceptionable, if any thing in it was. I have long wondered that the Original draft has not been published. I suppose the reason is the vehement Phillipic against Negro Slavery. As you justly observe, there is not an idea in it, but what had been hackney’d in Congress for two years before. The substance of it is contained in the declaration of rights and the violation of those rights, in the Journals of Congress in 1774. Indeed, the essence of it is contained in a pamphlet, voted and printed by the Town of Boston before the first Congress met; composed by James Otis, as I suppose—in one of his lucid intervals, and pruned and polished by Saml: Adams.

74,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass an American Slave, Written by Himself","Douglass, Frederick",b083_NarrativeFrederickDouglass.txt,4,"The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free. I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time, I got hold of a book entitled “The Columbian Orator.” Every opportunity I got, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master. In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm."
75,"“Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat: Address to Parliament on May 13th, 1940.”","Churchill, Winston",b084_BloodToilTearsandSweat.txt,4,"On Friday evening last I received from His Majesty the mission to form a new administration. It was the evident will of Parliament and the nation that this should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties.
I have already completed the most important part of this task.
A war cabinet has been formed of five members, representing, with the Labour, Opposition, and Liberals, the unity of the nation. It was necessary that this should be done in one single day on account of the extreme urgency and rigor of events. Other key positions were filled yesterday. I am submitting a further list to the king tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of principal ministers during tomorrow.
The appointment of other ministers usually takes a little longer. I trust when Parliament meets again this part of my task will be completed and that the administration will be complete in all respects. I considered it in the public interest to suggest to the Speaker that the House should be summoned today. At the end of today's proceedings, the adjournment of the House will be proposed until May 21 with provision for earlier meeting if need be. Business for that will be notified to MPs at the earliest opportunity.
I now invite the House by a resolution to record its approval of the steps taken and declare its confidence in the new government.
The resolution:
""That this House welcomes the formation of a government representing the united and inflexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the war with Germany to a victorious conclusion.""
To form an administration of this scale and complexity is a serious undertaking in itself. But we are in the preliminary phase of one of the greatest battles in history. We are in action at many other points — in Norway and in Holland — and we have to be prepared in the Mediterranean. The air battle is continuing, and many preparations have to be made here at home.
In this crisis I think I may be pardoned if I do not address the House at any length today, and I hope that any of my friends and colleagues or former colleagues who are affected by the political reconstruction will make all allowances for any lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to act.
I say to the House as I said to ministers who have joined this government, I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.
You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.
You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs — Victory in spite of all terrors — Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.
Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward his goal.
I take up my task in buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. I feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to claim the aid of all and to say, ""Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength.""

76,Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad,"Petry, Ann",b085_HarrietTubman.txt,4,"Chesapeake Bay forms the western boundary of the section of Maryland which is sometimes called Tidewater Maryland, sometimes called the Eastern Shore. Here there are so many coves and creeks, rivers and small streams, that the land areas are little more than heads or necks of land, almost surrounded by water. In these streams the ebb and flow of the tide is visible for miles inland—hence the name Tidewater Maryland. In 182o, much of the Eastern Shore was heavily wooded. The streams were filled with fish. Game birds—wild duck and snipe—abounded in all of the coves and marshes. It could truly be said that every plantation thereabout ""at its garden gate, has an oyster-bed, a fishing-bar, and a ducking blind."" The plantation that belonged to Edward Brodas, in Dorchester County, was typical of this section of Maryland, for one of its land boundaries was a river—the Big Buckwater River. It was more or less isolated. The nearest village, Bucktown, was little more than a settlement composed of post office, church, crossroads store, and eight or ten dwelling houses. There was an air of leisure about the planter's life here. Fishing and hunting were an integral part of it, just as it had been part of the life of the Indians, who had practically disappeared from the Eastern Shore by 1750. The house in which Edward Brodas lived was very large. There had to be room for his friends, his relatives, as well as his family. Visitors came from long distances, and so usually stayed a month or two before undertaking the journey back home. There were extra rooms for travelers, who carried the proper letters of introduction, because inns and taverns offered uncertain lodging for the night. Edward Brodas was known as the Master to his Negro slaves. His house, which the slaves called the Big House, stood near a country road. The kitchen was a small detached building in the rear, known as the cookhouse. Not too far away from the Big House were the stables, where the riding horses and the carriage horses, the grooms and the hostlers were housed. Close to the stables were the kitchen gardens and the cutting gardens. Beyond these lay the orchards and the barns for the work horses and cows and mules. The Big House, the cookhouse, the stables, formed a complete unit. Beyond this lay the fields, the clear cultivated land bordered by the forest. Out of sight of the Big House, but not quite out of hearing, was the 'quarter"" where the slaves lived. The quarter consisted of a group of one-room, windowless cabins. They were built of logs that had been cut from the nearby forests. The chinks were filled with mud. These roughhewn logs were filled with sap, and as they dried out, the wood contracting and expanding with changes in temperature, the roofs sagged, the walls budded. The narrow clay-daubed chimneys leaned as though some unseen pressure were forcing them over. Seen from a distance, these sway-backed cabins seemed to huddle together as though for protection. The fact that they were exactly alike, that they were surrounded by the same barren hard-packed earth, furthered the illusion. The cabins were exactly alike inside, too. There was a crude fireplace with one or two black iron pots standing in front of it. The hearth was merely a continuation of the dirt floor. When the wind blew hard, smoke came down the chimney, into the room, in puffs, so that the walls were smoke-darkened. Even in summer there was a characteristic smoky smell in the cabins. The fireplace not only provided heat in winter, it was the source of light, and it was used for cooking. Piles of old worn-out blankets served as beds. There were no chairs; so the occupants of the cabins either squatted in front of the fire or sat on the floor. In the middle of the dirt floor there was a large, fairly deep hole covered over with loose boards. This was the potato hole, where sweet potatoes were stored in winter to protect them from the frost. Harriet Greene, who was usually called Old RR, and her husband, Benjamin Ross, both slaves, lived in one of these windowless cabins, in the quarter, on the Brodas plantation. They had several children, some of whom still lived with them. The older children were ""hired out"" by the master, Edward Brodas, to farmers who needed slave labor but who could not afford to buy slaves. In 1820, Old RR had another baby. There was no record made of the date of the birth of this child, because neither Old Rit nor her husband, Ben, could read or write.
By the time Harriet Ross was six years old, she had unconsciously absorbed many kinds of knowledge, almost with the air she breathed. She could not, for example, have said how or at what moment she knew that she was a slave. She knew that her brothers and sisters, her father and mother, and all the other people who lived in the quarter, men, women and children were slaves. She had been taught to say, “Yes, Missus,” “No, Missus,” to white women, “Yes, Mas’r,” “No, Mas’r” to white men. Or, “Yes, sah,” “No, sah.” At the same time someone had taught her where to look for the North Star, the star that stayed constant, not rising in the east and setting in the west as the other stars appeared to do; and told her that anyone walking toward the North could use that star as a guide. She knew about fear, too. Sometimes at night, or during the day, she heard the furious galloping of horses, not just one horse, several horses, thud of the hoofbeats along the road, jingle of harness. She saw the grown folks freeze into stillness, not moving, scarcely breathing, while they listened. She could not remember who first told her that those furious hoofbeats meant that patrollers were going in pursuit of a runaway. Only the slaves said patterollers, whispering the word."
77,Travels with Charley: In Search of America,"Steinbeck, John",b086_TravelswithCharley.txt,4,"When I was very young and the urge to be someplace else was on me, I was assured by mature people that maturity would cure this itch. When years described me as mature, the remedy pre-scribed was middle age. In middle age I was assured that greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked. Four hoarse blasts of a ship's whistle still raise the hair on my neck and set my feet to tapping. The sound of a jet, an engine warming up, even the clopping of shod hooves on pavement brings on the ancient shudder, the dry mouth and vacant eye, the hot palms and the churn of stomach high up under the rib cage. In other words, I don't improve; in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear the disease is incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself. When the virus of restlessness begins to take possession of a wayward man, and the road away from Here seems broad and straight and sweet, the victim must first find in himself a good and sufficient reason for going. This to the practical bum is not difficult. He has a built-in garden of reasons to choose from. Next he must plan his trip in time and space, choose a direction and a destination. And last he must implement the journey. How to go, what to take, how long to stay. This part of the process is invariable and immortal. I set it down only so that newcomers to bumdom, like teen-agers in new-hatched sin, will not think they invented it. Once a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process; a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all other journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us. 
I soon discovered that if a wayfaring stranger wishes to eavesdrop on a local population the places for him to slip in and hold his peace are bars and churches. But some New England towns don’t have bars, and church is only on Sunday. A good alternative is the roadside restaurant where men gather for breakfast before going to work or going hunting. To find these places inhabited one must get up very early. And there is a drawback even to this. Early-rising men not only do not talk much to strangers, they barely talk to one another. Breakfast conversation is limited to a series of laconic grunts. The natural New England taciturnity reaches its glorious perfection at breakfast.
I am not normally a breakfast eater, but here I had to be or I wouldn’t see anybody unless I stopped for gas. At the first lighted roadside restaurant I pulled in and took my seat at a counter. The customers were folded over their coffee cups like ferns. A normal conversation is as follows: This is a really talkative customer.

79,A Night to Remember,"Lord, Walter",b088_ANighttoRemember.txt,4,"High in the crow’s-nest of the new White Star liner Titanic, lookout Frederick Fleet peered into a dazzling night. It was calm, clear and bitterly cold. There was no moon, but the cloudless sky blazed with stars. The Atlantic was like polished glass; people later said they had never seen it so smooth. This was the fifth night of the Titanic’s maiden voyage to New York, and it was already clear that she was not only the largest but also the most glamorous ship in the world. Even the passengers’ dogs were glamorous. John Jacob Astor had brought his Airedale Kitty. Henry Sleeper Harper, of the publishing family, had his prize Pekingese Sun Yat-Sen. Robert W. Daniel, the Philadelphia banker, was bringing back a champion French bulldog just purchased in Britain. Clarence Moore of Washington also had been dog-shopping, but the fifty pairs of English foxhounds he had bought for the Loudoun Hunt weren’t making the trip. That was all another world to Frederick Fleet. He was one of six lookouts carried by the Titanic, and the lookouts didn’t worry about passenger problems. They were the ‘eyes of the ship’, and on this particular night Fleet had been warned to watch especially for icebergs. So far, so good. On duty at 10 o’clock … a few words about the ice problem with lookout Reginald Lee, who shared the same watch … a few more words about the cold … but mostly just silence, as the two men stared into the darkness. Now the watch was almost over, and still there was nothing unusual. Just the night, the stars, the biting cold, the wind that whistled through the rigging as the Titanic raced across the calm, black sea at 22.5 knots. It was almost 11.40 p.m. on Sunday 14 April 1912. Suddenly Fleet saw something directly ahead, even darker than the darkness. At first it was small (about the size, he thought, of two tables put together), but every second it grew larger and closer. Quickly Fleet banged the crow’s-nest bell three times, the warning of danger ahead. At the same time he lifted the phone and rang the bridge. ‘What did you see?’ asked a calm voice at the other end. ‘Iceberg right ahead,’ replied Fleet. ‘Thank you,’ acknowledged the voice with curiously detached courtesy. Nothing more was said. For the next thirty-seven seconds Fleet and Lee stood quietly side by side, watching the ice draw nearer. Now they were almost on top of it, and still the ship didn’t turn. The berg towered wet and glistening far above the forecastle deck, and both men braced themselves for a crash. Then, miraculously, the bow began to swing to port. At the last second the stem shot into the clear, and the ice glided swiftly by along the starboard side. It looked to Fleet like a close shave. At this moment Quartermaster George Thomas Rowe was standing watch on the after bridge. For him too, it had been an uneventful night – just the sea, the stars, the biting cold. As he paced the deck, he noticed what he and his mates called ‘whiskers ’round the light’ – tiny splinters of ice in the air, fine as dust, that gave off myriads of bright colours whenever caught in the glow of the deck lights. Then suddenly he felt a curious motion break the steady rhythm of the engines. It was a little like coming alongside a dock wall rather heavily. He glanced forward – and stared again. A windjammer, sails set, seemed to be passing along the starboard side. Then he realized it was an iceberg, towering perhaps a hundred feet above the water. The next instant it was gone, drifting astern into the dark. Meanwhile, down below in the first-class dining-saloon on D deck, four other members of the Titanic’s crew were sitting round one of the tables. The last diner had long since departed, and now the big white Jacobean room was empty except for this single group. They were dining-saloon stewards, indulging in the time-honoured pastime of all stewards off duty – they were gossiping about their passengers. Then, as they sat there talking, a faint grinding jar seemed to come from somewhere deep inside the ship. It was not much, but enough to break the conversation and rattle the silver that was set for breakfast next morning. Steward James Johnson felt he knew just what it was. He recognized the kind of shudder a ship gives when she drops a propeller blade, and he knew this sort of mishap meant a trip back to the Harland & Wolff shipyard at Belfast – with plenty of free time to enjoy the hospitality of the port. Somebody near him agreed and sang out cheerfully, ‘Another Belfast trip!’ In the galley just to the stern, chief night baker Walter Belford was making rolls for the following day. (The honour of baking fancy pastry was reserved for the day shift.) When the jolt came, it impressed Belford more strongly than steward Johnson – perhaps because a pan of new rolls clattered off the top of the oven and scattered about the floor. The passengers in their cabins felt the jar too, and tried to connect it with something familiar. Marguerite Frolicher, a young Swiss girl accompanying her father on a business trip, woke up with a start. Half-asleep, she could think only of the little white lake ferries at Zurich making a sloppy landing. Softly she said to herself, ‘Isn’t it funny … we’re landing!’ Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen, starting to undress for the night, thought it was like a heavy wave striking the ship. Mrs J. Stuart White was sitting on the edge of her bed, just reaching to turn out the light, when the ship seemed to roll over ‘a thousand marbles’. To Lady Cosmo Duff Gordon, waking up from the jolt, it seemed ‘as though somebody had drawn a giant finger along the side of the ship’. Mrs John Jacob Astor thought it was some mishap in the kitchen. It seemed stronger to some than to others. Mrs Albert Caldwell pictured a large dog that had a baby kitten in its mouth and was shaking it. Mrs Walter B. Stephenson recalled the first ominous jolt when she was in the San Francisco earthquake – then decided this wasn’t that bad. Mrs E. D. Appleton felt hardly any shock at all, but she noticed an unpleasant ripping sound … like someone tearing a long, long strip of calico. The jar meant more to J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, who, in a festive mood, was going along for a ride on the Titanic’s first trip. Ismay woke up with a start in his de luxe suite on B deck – he felt sure the ship had struck something, but he didn’t know what. Some of the passengers already knew the answer. Mr and Mrs George A. Harder, a young honeymoon couple down in cabin E-50, were still awake when they heard a dull thump. Then they felt the ship quiver, and there was ‘a sort of rumbling, scraping noise’ along the ship’s side. Mr Harder hopped out of bed and ran to the porthole. As he looked through the glass, he saw a wall of ice glide by. The same thing happened to James B. McGough, a Gimbels buyer from Philadelphia, except his experience was more disturbing. His porthole was open, and as the berg brushed by, chunks of ice fell into the cabin. Like Mr McGough, most of the Titanic’s passengers were in bed when the jar came. On this quiet, cold Sunday night a snug bunk seemed about the best place to be. But a few shipboard diehards were still up. As usual, most were in the first-class smoking-room on A deck. And as usual, it was a very mixed group. Around one table sat Archie Butt, President Taft’s military aide; Clarence Moore, the travelling Master of Hounds; Harry Widener, son of the Philadelphia streetcar magnate; and William Carter, another Main Liner. They were winding up a small dinner given by Widener’s father in honour of Captain Edward J. Smith, the ship’s commander. The Captain had left early, the ladies had been packed off to bed, and now the men were enjoying a final cigar before turning in too. The conversation wandered from politics to Clarence Moore’s adventures in West Virginia, the time he helped to interview the old feuding mountaineer Anse Hatfield. Buried in a nearby leather armchair, Spencer V. Silverthorne, a young buyer for Nugent’s department store in St Louis, browsed through a new best-seller, The Virginian. Not far off, Lucien P. Smith (still another Philadelphian) struggled gamely through the linguistic problems of a bridge game with three Frenchmen. At another table the ship’s young set was enjoying a somewhat noisier game of bridge. Normally the young set preferred the livelier Café Parisien, just below on B deck, and at first tonight was no exception. But it grew so cold that around 11.30 the girls went off to bed, and the men strolled up to the smoking-room for a nightcap. Most of the group stuck to highballs; Hugh Woolner, son of the English sculptor, took a hot whisky and water; Lieutenant Hokan Bjornstrom Steffanson, a young Swedish military attaché on his way to Washington, chose a hot lemonade. Somebody produced a deck of cards, and as they sat playing and laughing, suddenly there came that grinding jar. Not much of a shock, but enough to give a man a start – Mr Silverthorne still sits up with a jolt when he tells it. In an instant the smoking-room steward and Mr Silverthorne were on their feet … through the aft door … past the Palm Court … and out on to the deck. They were just in time to see the iceberg scraping along the starboard side, a little higher than the boat deck. As it slid by, they watched chunks of ice breaking off and tumbling into the water. In another moment it faded into the darkness astern. Others in the smoking-room were pouring out now. As Hugh Woolner reached the deck, he heard a man call out, ‘We hit an iceberg – there it is!’ Woolner squinted into the night. About 150 yards astern he made out a mountain of ice standing black against the starlit sky. Then it vanished into the dark. The excitement, too, soon disappeared. The Titanic seemed as solid as ever, and it was too bitterly cold to stay outside any longer. Slowly the group filed back. Woolner picked up his hand, and the bridge game went on. The last man inside thought, as he slammed the deck door, that the engines were stopping. He was right. Up on the bridge First Officer William M. Murdoch had just pulled the engineroom telegraph handle all the way to ‘Stop’. Murdoch was in charge of the bridge this watch, and it was his problem, once Fleet phoned the warning. A tense minute had passed since then – orders to Quartermaster Hitchens to turn the wheel hard-a-starboard … a yank on the engineroom telegraph for ‘Full speed astern’ … a hard push on the button closing the watertight doors … and finally those thirty-seven seconds of breathless waiting. Now the waiting was over, and it was also clearly too late. As the grinding noise died away, Captain Smith rushed on to the bridge from his cabin next to the wheelhouse. There were a few quick words: ‘Mr Murdoch, what was that?’ ‘An iceberg, sir. I hard-a-starboarded and reversed the engines, and I was going to hard-aport around it, but she was too close. I couldn’t do any more.’ ‘Close the emergency doors.’ ‘The doors are already closed.’ They were closed all right. Down in boiler room No. 6 fireman Fred Barrett had been talking to second engineer James Hesketh when the warning bell sounded and the light flashed red above the watertight door leading to the stern. A quick shout of warning – an ear-splitting crash – and the whole starboard side of the ship seemed to give way. The sea cascaded in, swirling about the pipes and valves, and the two men leaped through the door as it slammed down behind them. Barrett found things almost as bad where he was now, in boiler room No. 5. The gash ran into No. 5 about two feet beyond the closed compartment door, and a fat jet of sea-water was spouting through the hole. Nearby, trimmer George Cavell was digging himself out of an avalanche of coal that had poured out of a bunker with the impact. Another stoker mournfully studied an overturned bowl of soup that had been warming on a piece of machinery. It was dry in the other boiler rooms further aft, but the scene was pretty much the same – men picking themselves up, calling back and forth, asking what had happened. It was hard to figure out. Until now the Titanic had been a picnic. Being a new ship on her maiden voyage, everything was clean. She was, as fireman George Kemish still recalls, ‘a good job … not what we were accustomed to in old ships, slogging our guts out and nearly roasted by the heat’. All the firemen had to do was keep the furnaces full. No need to work the fires with slice bars, pricker bars and rakes. So on this Sunday night the men were taking it easy – sitting around on buckets and the trimmers’ iron wheelbarrows, gossiping, waiting for the twelve-tofour watch to come on. Then came that thud … the grinding, tearing sound … the telegraphs ringing wildly … the watertight doors crashing down. Most of the men couldn’t imagine what it was – the story spread that the Titanic had gone aground just off the Banks of Newfoundland. Many of them still thought so, even after a trimmer came running down from above shouting, ‘Blimey! We’ve struck an iceberg!’ About ten miles away Third Officer Charles Victor Groves stood on the bridge of the Leyland liner Californian, bound from London to Boston. A plodding 6,000-tonner, she had room for forty-seven passengers, but none were being carried just now. On this Sunday night she had been stopped since 10.30 p.m., completely blocked by drifting ice. At about 11.10 Groves noticed the lights of another ship, racing up from the east on the starboard side. As the newcomer rapidly overhauled the motionless Californian, a blaze of deck lights showed she was a large passenger liner. Around 11.30 he knocked on the Venetian door of the chart room and told Captain Stanley Lord about it. Lord suggested contacting the new arrival by Morse lamp, and Groves prepared to do this. Then, at about 11.40, he saw the big ship suddenly stop and put out most of her lights. This didn’t surprise Groves very much. He had spent some time in the Far East trade, where they usually put deck lights out at midnight to encourage the passengers to turn in. It never occurred to him that perhaps the lights were still on … that they only seemed to go out because she was no longer broadside but had veered sharply to port."
80,A Short Walk through the Pyramids and through the World of Art,"Isaacson, Phillip",b089_AShortWalkthroughthePyramids.txt,4,"At Giza, a few miles north of Saqqara, sit three great pyramids, each named for the king – or Pharaoh – during whose reign it was built. No other buildings are so well known, yet the first sight of them sitting in their field is breathtaking. When you walk among them, you walk in a place made for giants. They seem too large to have been made by human beings, too perfect to have been formed by nature, and when the sun is overhead, not solid enough to be attached to the sand. In the minutes before sunrise, they are the color of faded roses, and when the last rays of the desert sun touch them, they turn to amber. But whatever the light, their broad proportions, the beauty of the limestone, and the care with which it is fitted into place create three unforgettable works of art. What do we learn about art when we look at the pyramids? First, when all of the things that go into a work – its components – complement one another, they create and object that has a certain spirit, and we can call that spirit harmony. The pyramids are harmonious because limestone, a warm, quiet material, is a cordial companion for a simple, logical, pleasing shape. In fact, the stone and the shape are so comfortable with each other that the pyramids seem inevitable – as though they were bound to have the form, color, and texture that they do have."
81,The Great Fire,"Murphy, Jim",b090_TheGreatFire.txt,4,"Chicago in 1871 was a city ready to burn. The city boasted having 59,500 buildings, many of them—such as the Courthouse and the Tribune Building—large and ornately decorated. The trouble was that about two-thirds of all these structures were made entirely of wood. Many of the remaining buildings (even the ones proclaimed to be “fireproof”) looked solid, but were actually jerrybuilt affairs; the stone or brick exteriors hid wooden frames and floors, all topped with highly flammable tar or shingle roofs. It was also a common practice to disguise wood as another kind of building material. The fancy exterior decorations on just about every building were carved from wood, then painted to look like stone or marble. Most churches had steeples that appeared to be solid from the street, but a closer inspection would reveal a wooden framework covered with cleverly painted copper or tin. The situation was worst in the middle-class and poorer districts. Lot sizes were small, and owners usually filled them up with cottages, barns, sheds, and outhouses—all made of fast-burning wood, naturally. Because both Patrick and Catherine O’Leary worked, they were able to put a large addition on their cottage despite a lot size of just 25 by 100 feet. Interspersed in these residential areas were a variety of businesses—paint factories, lumberyards, distilleries, gasworks, mills, furniture manufacturers, warehouses, and coal distributors. Wealthier districts were by no means free of fire hazards. Stately stone and brick homes had wood interiors, and stood side by side with smaller wood-frame houses. Wooden stables and other storage buildings were common, and trees lined the streets and filled the yards."
82,Vincent Van Gogh: Portrait of an Artist,"Greenberg, Jan, and Sandra Jordan",b091_VincentVanGoghPortraitofanArtist.txt,4,"I have nature and art and poetry, if that is not enough what is? On March 30, 1853, the handsome, soberly dressed Reverend Theodorus van Gogh entered the ancient town hall of Groot-Zundert, in the Brabant, a province of the Netherlands. He opened the birth register to number twenty-nine, where exactly one year earlier he had sadly written “Vincent Willem van Gogh, stillborn.” Beside the inscription he wrote again “Vincent Willem van Gogh,” the name of his new, healthy son, who was sleeping soundly next to his mother in the tiny parsonage across the square. The baby’s arrival was an answered prayer for the still-grieving family. The first Vincent lay buried in a tiny grave by the door of the church where Pastor van Gogh preached. The Vincent who lived grew to be a sturdy redheaded boy. Every Sunday on his way to church, young Vincent would pass the headstone carved with the name he shared. Did he feel as if his dead brother where the rightful Vincent, the one who would remain perfect in his parents’ hearts, and that he was merely an unsatisfactory replacement? That might have been one of the reasons he spent so much of his life feeling like a lonely outsider, as if he didn’t fit anywhere in the world. Despite his dramatic beginning, Vincent had an ordinary childhood, giving no hint of the painter he would become. The small parsonage, with an upstairs just two windows wide under a slanting roof, quickly grew crowded. By the time he was six he had two sisters, Anna and Elizabeth, and one brother, Theo, whose gentle nature made him their mother’s favorite."
83,This Land Was Made for You and Me: The Life and Songs of Woody Guthrie,"Partridge, Elizabeth",b092_ThisLandWasMadeforYou.txt,4,"“I hate a song that makes you think that you’re not any good. I hate a song that makes you think you are just born to lose. I am out to fight those kind of songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood.” Woody Guthrie could never cure himself of wandering off. One minute he’d be there, the next he’d be gone, vanishing without a word to anyone, abandoning those he loved best. He’d throw on a few extra shirts, one on top of the other, sling his guitar over his shoulder, and hit the road. He’d stick out his thumb and hitchhike, swing onto moving freight trains, and hunker down with other traveling men in flophouses, hobo jungles, and Hoovervilles across Depression America. He moved restlessly from state to state, soaking up some songs: work songs, mountain and cowboy songs, sea chanteys, songs from the southern chain gangs. He added them to the dozens he already knew from his childhood until he was bursting with American folk songs. Playing the guitar and singing, he started making up new ones: hard-bitten, rough-edged songs that told it like it was, full of anger and hardship and hope and love. Woody said the best songs came to him when he was walking down a road. He always had fifteen or twenty songs running around in his mind, just waiting to be put together. Sometimes he knew the words, but not the melody. Usually he’d borrow a tune that was already well known—the simpler the better. As he walked along, he tried to catch a good, easy song that people could sing the first time they heard it, remember, and sing again later."
84,Words We Live By: Your Annotated Guide to the Constitution,"Monk, Linda R",b093_WordsWeLiveBy.txt,4,"The first three word of the Constitution are the most important. They clearly state that the people—not the king, not the legislature, not the courts—are the true rulers in American government. This principle is known as popular sovereignty. But who are “We the People”? This question troubled the nation for centuries. As Lucy Stone, one of America’s first advocates for women’s rights, asked in 1853, “‘We the People’? Which ‘We the People’? The women were not included.” Neither were white males who did not own property, American Indians, or African Americans—slave or free. Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African American on the Supreme Court, described the limitation: For a sense of the evolving nature of the Constitution, we need look no further than the first three words of the document’s preamble: ‘We the People.’ When the Founding Fathers used this phrase in 1787, they did not have in mind the majority of America’s citizens . . . The men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 could not . . . have imagined, nor would they have accepted, that the document they were drafting would one day be construed by a Supreme court to which had been appointed a woman and the descendant of an African slave. Through the Amendment process, more and more Americans were eventually included in the Constitution’s definition of “We the People.” After the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment gave African Americans citizenship, and the Fifteenth Amendment gave black men the vote. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote nationwide, and in 1971, the Twenty-sixth Amendment extended suffrage to eighteen-year-olds."
85,Freedom Walkers: The Story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott,"Freedman, Russell",b094_FreedomWalkers.txt,4,"Not so long ago in Montgomery, Alabama, the color of your skin determined where you could sit on a public bus. If you happened to be an African American, you had to sit in the back of the bus, even if there were empty seats up front. Back then, racial segregation was the rule throughout the American South. Strict laws—called “Jim Crow” laws—enforced a system of white supremacy that discriminated against blacks and kept them in their place as second-class citizens. People were separated by race from the moment they were born in segregated hospitals until the day they were buried in segregated cemeteries. Blacks and whites did not attend the same schools, worship in the same churches, eat in the same restaurants, sleep in the same hotels, drink from the same water fountains, or sit together in the same movie theaters. In Montgomery, it was against the law for a white person and a Negro to play checkers on public property or ride together in a taxi. Most southern blacks were denied their right to vote. The biggest obstacle was the poll tax, a special tax that was required of all voters but was too costly for many blacks and for poor whites as well. Voters also had to pass a literacy test to prove that they could read, write, and understand the U.S. Constitution. These tests were often rigged to disqualify even highly educated blacks. Those who overcame the obstacles and insisted on registering as voters faced threats, harassment. And even physical violence. As a result, African Americans in the South could not express their grievances in the voting booth, which for the most part, was closed to them. But there were other ways to protest, and one day a half century ago, the black citizens in Montgomery rose up in protest and united to demand their rights—by walking peacefully. It all started on a bus."
86,Cathedral: The Story of Its Construction,"Macaulay, David",b095_CathedralTheStoryofItsConstruction.txt,4,"In order to construct the vaulted ceiling a wooden scaffold was erected connecting the two walls of the choir one hundred and thirty feet above ground. On the scaffolding wooden centerings like those used for the flying buttresses were installed. They would support the arched stone ribs until the mortar was dry, at which times the ribs could support themselves. The ribs carried the webbing, which was the ceiling itself. The vaults were constructed one bay at a time, a bay being the rectangular area between four piers. One by one, the cut stones of the ribs, called voussoirs, were hoisted onto the centering and mortared into place by the masons. Finally the keystone was lowered into place to lock the ribs together at the crown, the highest point of the arch. The carpenters then installed pieces of wood, called lagging, that spanned the space between two centerings. On top of the lagging the masons laid one course or layer of webbing stones. The lagging supported the course of webbing until the mortar was dry. The webbing was constructed of the lightest possible stone to lessen the weight on the ribs. Two teams, each with a mason and a carpenter, worked simultaneously from both sides of the vault – installing first the lagging, then the webbing. When they met in the center the vault was complete. The vaulting over the aisle was constructed in the same way and at the same time. When the mortar in the webbing had set, a four-inch layer of concrete was poured over the entire vault to prevent any cracking between the stones. Once the concrete had set, the lagging was removed and the centering was lowered and moved onto the scaffolding of the next bay. The procedure was repeated until eventually the entire choir was vaulted."
87,The Building of Manhattan,"Mackay, Donald",b096_TheBuildingofManhattan.txt,4,"On June 8, 1654. Tennis Tomasen was again in court, demanding 13 florins from Michael Paulisen. for whom he had built a chimney according to contract. The chimney smoked and Paulisen had had it pulled down and rebuilt by someone else, at a cost of two beavers. He said he did not owe the debt. The court decided in favor of Tomasen: since defendant Paulisen ""at his own pleasure had the chimney taken down and rebuilt, plaintiff cannot be prejudiced thereby."" Many of these early chimneys were wooden, above thatched reed roofs. Fire was a constant danger to the town. If a house burned down due to the negligence of the owner, he was fined 25 guilders. Four firewarders were appointed to inspect all chimneys: an unclean one was fined three guilders. with the money used to maintain the town's fire ladders. hooks, and leather water buckets. Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his council, In 1647. ordered people who had been granted lots to put up proper buildings on them, or the lots would be taken from them and given to people who wanted to build and were in need of a proper place. All sales of real estate had to be approved by the authorities to prevent fraud. Moreover, in 1655 a commission of four surveyed the entire town. with orders to straighten out streets and fix the location of lots. They not only laid out seventeen streets, they surveyed and fixed prices for the lots."

I assume you have one. “Sure, but we’re not allowed to use them in school.” “I see,” said the number devil. “That’s all right. There’s nothing wrong with a little addition and subtraction. You never know when your battery will die on you. But mathematics, my boy, that’s something else again!” “The thing that makes numbers so devilish is precisely that they are simple. And you don’t need a calculator to prove it. You need one thing and one thing only: one. With one—I am speaking of the numeral of course—you can do almost anything. If you are afraid of large numbers—let’s say five million seven hundred and twenty-three thousand eight hundred and twelve—all you have to do is start with 1 and go on until you come to five million etcetera.

89,Math Trek: Adventures in the Math Zone,"Peterson, Ivars and Nancy Henderson",b098_MathTrekAdventuresintheMathone.txt,4,"From the meanderings of a pond’s edge to the branching of trees and the intricate forms of snowflakes, shapes in
nature are often more complicated than geometrical shapes such as circles, spheres, angles, cones, rectangles, and
cubes. Benoit Mandelbrot, a mathematics professor at Yale University and an IBM fellow, was the first person to recognize how amazingly common this type of structure is in nature. In 1975, he coined the term fractal for shapes that
repeat themselves within an object. The word fractal comes from the Latin term for “broken.”
In 1904, long before Mandelbrot conceived of fractals, Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch created and intriguing but puzzling curve. It zigzags in such an odd pattern that it seems impossible to start at one point and follow the
curve to reach another point.
Like many figures now known to be fractals, Koch’s curve is easy to generate by starting with a simple figure and
turning it into an increasingly crinkly form.
What to Do
Draw an equilateral triangle with each side measuring 9 centimeters. (Remember, each angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60.)
Divide each 9-centimeter side into three parts, each measuring three centimeters. At the middle of each side, add
an equilateral triangle one third the size of the original, facing outward. Because each side of the original triangle is 9
centimeters, the new triangles will have 3-centimeter sides. When you examine the outer edge of your diagram you
should see a six-pointed star made up of 12 line segments.
At the middle of each segment of the star, add a triangle one ninth the side of the original triangle. The new triangles will have sides 1 centimeter in length so divide each 3-centimeter segment into thirds, and use the middle third
to form a new triangle.
Going one step farther, you create a shape that begins to resemble a snowflake. If you were to continue the process
by endlessly adding smaller and smaller triangles to every new side, you would produce the Koch snowflake curve.
Between any two points, the snowflake would have an infinite number of zigzags. "

of Caldwell. Two doors down, chickens paraded around the street.
The apartment itself was dominated by two computers that sat across from the front door like twin shrines. Everything else-the piles of dirty laundry, the opened Doritos bags, the empty cans of generic soda pop, two ratty old
chairs, and a moldering beanbag chair-was dispensable, an afterthought, props.
Jesse’s computer was a Pentium 11 300, Asus P2B (Intel BX chipset) motherboard; a Matrix Milleniurn II AGP; 160 MB
SDRAM with a 15.5 GB total hard-drive space; a 4X CD-recorder; 24X CD-ROM; a 17-inch Micron monitor. Plus a scanner and printer. A well-thumbed paperback-Katherine Dunn’s novel Geek Love-served as his mousepad.

91,“The Evolution of the Grocery Bag.”,"Petroski, Henry",b100_TheEvolutionoftheGroceryBag.txt,4,"That much-reviled bottleneck known as the American supermarket checkout lane would be an even greater exercise in frustration were it not for several technological advances. The Universal Product Code and the decoding laser scanner, introduced in 1974, tally a shopper’s groceries far more quickly and accurately than the old method of inputting each purchase manually into a cash register. But beeping a large order past the scanner would have led only to a faster pileup of cans and boxes down the line, where the bagger works, had it not been for the introduction, more than a century earlier, of an even greater technological masterpiece: the square-bottomed paper bag. The geometry of paper bags continues to hold a magical appeal for those of us who are fascinated by how ordinary things are designed and made. Originally, grocery bags were created on demand by storekeepers, who cut, folded, and pasted sheets of paper, making versatile containers into which purchases could be loaded for carrying home. The first paper bags manufactured commercially are said to have been made in Bristol, England, in the 1840s. In 1852, a “Machine for Making Bags of Paper” was patented in America by Francis Wolle, of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. According to Wolle’s own description of the machine’s operation, “pieces of paper of suitable length are given out from a roll of the required width, cut off from the roll and otherwise suitably cut to the required shape, folded, their edges pasted and lapped, and formed into complete and perfect bags.” The “perfect bags” produced at the rate of eighteen hundred per hour by Wolle’s machine were, of course, not perfect, nor was his machine. The history of design has yet to see the development of a perfect object, though it has seen many satisfactory ones and many substantially improved ones. The concept of comparative improvement is embedded in the paradigm for invention, the better mousetrap. No one is ever likely to lay claim to a “best” mousetrap, for that would preclude the inventor himself from coming up with a still better mousetrap without suffering the embarrassment of having previously declared the search complete. As with the mousetrap, so with the bag."
92,U*X*L Encyclopedia of Science,"“Geology""",b101_UXLEncyclopediaofScience.txt,4,"Geology is the scientific study of Earth. Geologists study the planet—its formation, its internal structure, its materials, its chemical and physical processes, and its history. Mountains, valleys, plains, sea floors, minerals, rocks, fossils, and the processes that create and destroy each of these are all the domain of the geologist. Geology is divided into two broad categories of study: physical geology and historical geology. Physical geology is concerned with the processes occurring on or below the surface of Earth and the materials on which they operate. These processes include volcanic eruptions, landslides, earthquakes, and floods. Materials include rocks, air, seawater, soils, and sediment. Physical geology further divides into more specific branches, each of which deals with its own part of Earth’s materials, landforms, and processes. Mineralogy and petrology investigate the composition and origin of minerals and rocks. Volcanologists study lava, rocks, and gases on live, dormant, and extinct volcanoes. Seismologists use instruments to monitor and predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Historical geology is concerned with the chronology of events, both physical and biological, that have taken place in Earth’s history. Paleontologists study fossils (remains of ancient life) for evidence of the evolution of life on Earth. Fossils not only relate evolution, but also speak of the environment in which the organism lived. Corals in rocks at the top of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, for example, show a shallow sea flooded the area around 290 million years ago. In addition, by determining the ages and types of rocks around the world, geologists piece together continental and oceanic history over the past few billion years. Plate tectonics (the study of the movement of the sections of Earth’s crust) adds to Earth’s story with details of the changing configuration of the continents and oceans."

The purpose of such missions is to make scientific observations, such as taking pictures, measuring atmospheric conditions, and collecting soil samples, and to bring or report the data back to Earth. Numerous space probes have been launched since the former Soviet Union first fired Luna 1 toward the Moon in 1959. Probes have now visited each of the eight planets in the solar system. In fact, two probes—Voyager 1 and Voyager 2—are approaching the edge of the solar system, for their eventual trip into the interstellar medium. By January 2008 Voyager 1 was about 9.4 billion miles (15.2 billion kilometers) from the Sun and in May 2008 it entered the heliosheath (the boundary where the solar wind is thought to end), which is the area that roughly divides the solar system from interstellar space. Voyager 2 is not quite as far as its sister probe. Voyager 1 is expected to be the first human space probe to leave the solar system. Both Voyager probes are still transmitting signals back to Earth. They are expected to help gather further information as to the true boundary of the solar system. The earliest probes traveled to the closest extraterrestrial target, the Moon. The former Soviet Union launched a series of Luna probes that provided humans with first pictures of the far side of the Moon. In 1966, Luna 9 made the first successful landing on the Moon and sent back television footage from the Moon’s surface. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) initially made several unsuccessful attempts to send a probe to the Moon. Not until 1964 did a Ranger probe reach its mark and send back thousands of pictures. Then, a few months after Luna 9, NASA landed Surveyor on the Moon. In the meantime, NASA was moving ahead with the first series of planetary probes, called Mariner. Mariner 2 first reached the planet Venus in 1962. Later Mariner spacecrafts flew by Mars in 1964 and 1969, providing detailed images of that planet. In 1971, Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to orbit Mars. During its year in orbit, Mariner 9’s two television cameras transmitted footage of an intense Martian dust storm, as well as images of 90 percent of the planet’s surface and the two Martian natural satellites (moons). Encounters were also made with Mars in 1976 by the U.S. probes Viking 1 and Viking 2. Each Viking spacecraft consisted of both an orbiter and a lander. Viking 1 made the first successful soft landing on Mars on July 20, 1976. Soon after, Viking 2 landed on the opposite side of the planet. The Viking orbiters made reports on the Martian weather and photographed almost the entire surface of the planet."
94,Invasive Plant Inventory,California Invasive Plant Council,b104_InvasivePlantInventory.txt,4,"The Inventory categorizes plants as High, Moderate, or Limited, reflecting the level of each species’ negative ecological impact in California. Other factors, such as economic impact or difficulty of management, are not included in this assessment. It is important to note that even Limited species are invasive and should be of concern to land managers. Although the impact of each plant varies regionally, its rating represents cumulative impacts statewide. Therefore, a plant whose statewide impacts are categorized as Limited may have more severe impacts in a particular region. Conversely, a plant categorized as having a High cumulative impact across California may have very little impact in some regions. The Inventory Review Committee, Cal-IPC staff, and volunteers drafted assessments for each plant based on the formal criteria system described below. The committee solicited information from land managers across the state to complement the available literature. Assessments were released for public review before the committee finalized them. The 2006 list includes 39 High species, 65 Moderate species, and 89 Limited species. Additional information, including updated observations, will be added to this website periodically, with revisions tracked and dated. The Inventory categorizes “invasive non-native plants that threaten wildlands” according to the definitions below. Plants were evaluated only if they invade California wildlands with native habitat values. The Inventory does not include plants found solely in areas of human-caused disturbance such as roadsides and cultivated agricultural fields.

Wildlands are public and private lands that support native ecosystems, including some working landscapes such as grazed rangeland and active timberland.
Non-native plants are species introduced to California after European contact and as a direct or indirect result of human activity.

Invasive non-native plants that threaten wildlands are plants that 1) are not native to, yet can spread into, wildland ecosystems, and that also 2) displace native species, hybridize with native species, alter biological communities, or alter ecosystem processes.

95,The Odyssey,Homer,b105_TheOdyssey.txt,5,"Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.

So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home.

Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:

""See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for everything in full.""

Then Minerva said, ""Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as he did; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?""

And Jove said, ""My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.""

And Minerva said, ""Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca, to put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear father- for this will make people speak well of him.""

So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.

Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come to his own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. ""Welcome,"" said he, ""to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for.""

He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were within he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against a strong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.

A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.

Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom they compelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head close to hers that no man might hear.

""I hope, sir,"" said he, ""that you will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself.""

And Minerva answered, ""I will tell you truly and particularly all about it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will I am no prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen the other.""

""My mother,"" answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses, but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father.""

And Minerva said, ""There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them.""

""Sir,"" said Telemachus, ""as regards your question, so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself.""

""Is that so?"" exclaimed Minerva, ""then you do indeed want Ulysses home again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and if he is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.

""But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay your case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother's mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.""

""Sir,"" answered Telemachus, ""it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present, and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsake such as only dear friends give to one another.""

Minerva answered, ""Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value in return.""

With these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.

Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.

""Phemius,"" she cried, ""you know many another feat of gods and heroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos.""

""Mother,"" answered Telemachus, ""let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, and mine above all others- for it is I who am master here.""

She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.

Then Telemachus spoke, ""Shameless,"" he cried, ""and insolent suitors, let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you.""

The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, ""The gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before you.""

Telemachus answered, ""Antinous, do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it brings both riches and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.""

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, ""It rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him.""

""My father is dead and gone,"" answered Telemachus, ""and even if some rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's."" But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.

The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a tower that looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him."
96,Metamorphoses,Ovid,b106_Metamorphoses.txt,5,"Wait nymph, daughter of Peneus, I beg you! I who am chasing you am not your enemy. Nymph, Wait! This is the way
a sheep runs from the wolf, a deer from the mountain lion, and a dove with fluttering wings flies from the eagle: everything flies from its foes, but it is love that is driving me to follow you! Pity me! I am afraid you might fall headlong
or thorns undeservedly scar your legs and I be a cause of grief to you! These are rough places you run through. Slow
down, I ask you, check your flight, and I too will slow. At least enquire whom it is you have charmed. I am no mountain
man, no shepherd, no rough guardian of the herds and flocks. Rash girl, you do not know, you cannot realise, who
you run from, and so you run. Delphis lands are mine, Claros and Tenedos, and Patara acknowledges me king. Jupiter
is my father. Through me what was, what is, and what will be, are revealed. Through me strings sound in harmony,
to song. My aim is certain, but an arrow truer than mine, has wounded my free heart! The whole world calls me the
bringer of aid; medicine is my invention; my power is in herbs. But love cannot be healed by any herb, nor can the arts
that cure others cure their lord!
He would have said more as timid Penes ran, still lovely to see, leaving him with his words unfinished. The winds
bared her body, the opposing breezes in her way fluttered her clothes, and the light airs threw her streaming hair
behind her, her beauty enhanced by flight. But the young god could no longer waste time on further blandishments,
urged on by Amor, he ran on at full speed. Like a hound of Gaul starting a hare in an empty field, that heads for its
prey, she for safety: he, seeming about to clutch her, thinks now, or now, he has her fast, grazing her heels with his
outstretched jaws, while she uncertain whether she is already caught, escaping his bite, spurts from the muzzle touching her. So the virgin and the god: he driven by desire, she by fear. He ran faster, Amor giving him wings, and allowed
her no rest, hung on her fleeing shoulders, breathed on the hair flying round her neck. Her strength was gone, she 
grew pale, overcome by the effort of her rapid flight, and seeing Peneuss waters near cried out Help me father! If
your streams have divine powers change me, destroy this beauty that pleases too well! Her prayer was scarcely done
when a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into
branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing roots, her face was lost in the canopy. Only her
shining beauty was left.
Even like this Phoebus loved her and, placing his hand against the trunk, he felt her heart still quivering under the new
bark. He clasped the branches as if they were parts of human arms, and kissed the wood. But even the wood shrank
from his kisses, and the god said Since you cannot be my bride, you must be my tree! Laurel, with you my hair will
be wreathed, with you my lyre, with you my quiver. You will go with the Roman generals when joyful voices acclaim
their triumph, and the Capitol witnesses their long processions. You will stand outside Augustuss doorposts, a faithful guardian, and keep watch over the crown of oak between them. And just as my head with its un-cropped hair is
always young, so you also will wear the beauty of undying leaves. Paean had done: the laurel bowed her newly made
branches, and seemed to shake her leafy crown like a head giving consent."
97,“The Nose.”,"Gogol, Nikolai",b107_TheNose.txt,5,"An extraordinarily strange thing happened in St. Petersburg on 25 March. Ivan Yakovlevich, a barber who lived on
Voznesensky Avenue (his surname has got lost and all that his shop-front signboard shows is a gentleman with a
lathered cheek and the inscription We also let blood) woke up rather early one morning and smelt hot bread. As he
sat up in bed he saw his wife, who was a quite respectable lady and a great coffee-drinker, taking some freshly baked
rolls out of the oven.
I dont want any coffee today, Praskovya Osipovna, said Ivan Yakovlevich. Ill make do with some hot rolls and onion
instead. (Here I must explain that Ivan Yakovlevich would really have liked to have had some coffee as well, but knew
it was quite out of the question to expect both coffee and rolls, since Praskovya Osipovna did not take very kindly to
these whims of his.) Let the old fool have his bread, I dont mind, she thought. That means extra coffee for me! And
she threw a roll on to the table.
Ivan pulled his frock-coat over his nightshirt for decencys sake, sat down at the table, poured out some salt, peeled
two onions, took a knife and with a determined expression on his face started cutting one of the rolls.
When he had sliced the roll in two, he peered into the middle and was amazed to see something white there. Ivan
carefully picked at it with his knife, and felt it with his finger. Quite thick, he said to himself. What on earth can it be?
He poked two fingers in and pulled outa nose!
He flopped back in his chair, and began rubbing his eyes and feeling around in the roll again. Yes, it was a nose all
right, no mistake about that. And, whats more, it seemed a very familiar nose. His face filled with horror. But this horror was nothing compared with his wifes indignation.
You beast, whose nose is that youve cut off? she cried furiously. You scoundrel! You drunkard! Ill report it to the
police myself, I will. You thief! Come to think of it, Ive heard three customers say that when they come in for a shave
you start pulling their noses about so much its a wonder they stay on at all!
But Ivan felt more dead than alive. He knew that the nose belonged to none other than Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov,
whom he shaved on Wednesdays and Sundays.
Wait a minute, Praskovya! Ill wrap it up in a piece of cloth and dump it in the corner. Lets leave it there for a bit, then
Ill try and get rid of it.
I dont want to know! Do you think Im going to let a sawn-off nose lie about in my room ... you fathead! All you can
do is strop that blasted razor of yours and let everything else go to pot. Layabout! Night-bird! And you expect me to
cover up for you with the police! You filthy pig! Blockhead! Get that nose out of here, out! Do what you like with it, but
I dont want that thing hanging around here a minute longer!
Ivan Yakovlevich was absolutely stunned. He thought and thought, but just didnt know what to make of it.
Im damned if I know whats happened! he said at last, scratching the back of his ear. I cant say for certain if I came
home drunk or not last night. All I know is, its crazy. After all, bread is baked in an oven, and you dont get noses in
bakeries. Cant make head or tail of it! ...
Ivan Yakovlevich lapsed into silence. The thought that the police might search the place, find the nose and afterwards
bring a charge against him, very nearly sent him out of his mind. Already he could see that scarlet collar beautifully
embroidered with silver, that sword ... and he began shaking all over. Finally he put on his scruffy old trousers and 
shoes and with Praskovya Osipovnas vigorous invective ringing in his ears, wrapped the nose up in a piece of cloth
and went out into the street.
All he wanted was to stuff it away somewhere, either hiding it between two curb-stones by someones front door
or else accidentally dropping it and slinking off down a side street. But as luck would have it, he kept bumping into
friends, who would insist on asking: Where are you off to? or Its a bit early for shaving customers, isnt it? with the
result that he didnt have a chance to get rid of it. Once he did manage to drop it, but a policeman pointed with his
halberd and said: Pick that up! Cant you see you dropped something! And Ivan Yakovlevich had to pick it up and
hide it in his pocket. Despair gripped him, especially as the streets were getting more and more crowded now as the
shops and stalls began to open.
He decided to make his way to St. Isaacs Bridge and see if he could throw the nose into the River Neva without
anyone seeing him. But here I am rather at fault for not telling you before something about Ivan Yakovlevich, who in
many ways was a man you could respect."
98,"A. M. Candide, Or The Optimist","De Voltaire, F",b108_AMCandideOrTheOptimist.txt,5,"Nature had endowed with a most sweet disposition. His face was the true index of his mind. He had a solid judgment
joined to the most unaffected simplicity; and hence, I presume, he had his name of Candide. The old servants of the
house suspected him to have been the son of the Baron’s sister, by a very good sort of a gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady refused to marry, because he could produce no more than threescore and eleven
quarterings in his arms; the rest of the genealogical tree belonging to the family having been lost through the injuries
of time.
The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had not only a gate, but even windows,
and his great hall was hung with tapestry. He used to hunt with his mastiffs and spaniels instead of greyhounds; his
groom served him for huntsman; and the parson of the parish officiated as his grand almoner. He was called “My
Lord” by all his people, and he never told a story but everyone laughed at it.
My Lady Baroness, who weighed three hundred and fifty pounds, consequently was a person of no small consideration; and then she did the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded universal respect. Her daughter was
about seventeen years of age, fresh-colored, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron’s son seemed to be a youth
in every respect worthy of the father he sprung from. Pangloss, the preceptor, was the oracle of the family, and little
Candide listened to his instructions with all the simplicity natural to his age and disposition.
Master Pangloss taught the metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology. He could prove to admiration that there is no
effect without a cause; and, that in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron’s castle was the most magnificent of all
castles, and My Lady the best of all possible baronesses.
“It is demonstrable,” said he, “that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for
some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles,
therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were
made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the
province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and
they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.”
Candide listened attentively and believed implicitly, for he thought Miss Cunegund excessively handsome, though he
never had the courage to tell her so. He concluded that next to the happiness of being Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh,
the next was that of being Miss Cunegund, the next that of seeing her every day, and the last that of hearing the doctrine of Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world.
One day when Miss Cunegund went to take a walk in a little neighboring wood which was called a park, she saw,
through the bushes, the sage Doctor Pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mother’s chambermaid, a little brown wench, very pretty, and very tractable.
As Miss Cunegund had a great disposition for the sciences, she observed with the utmost attention the experiments
which were repeated before her eyes; she perfectly well understood the force of the doctor’s reasoning upon causes
and effects. She retired greatly flurried, quite pensive and filled with the desire of knowledge, imagining that she
might be a sufficing reason for young Candide, and he for her.
In her way back she happened to meet the young man; she blushed, he blushed also; she wished him a good morning
in a flattering tone, he returned the salute, without knowing what he said. The next day, as they were rising from dinner, Cunegund and Candide slipped behind the screen. The miss dropped her handkerchief, the young man picked it
up. She innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a grace-all very 
particular; their lips met; their eyes sparkled; their knees trembled; their hands strayed. The Baron chanced to come
by; he beheld the cause and effect, and, without hesitation, saluted Candide with some notable kicks on the breech
and drove him out of doors. "
99,Fathers and Sons,"Turgenev, Ivan",b109_FathersandSons.txt,5,"WELL, Piotr, not in sight yet? was the question asked on May the 20th, 1859, by a gentleman of a little over forty, in
a dusty coat and checked trousers, who came out without his hat on to the low steps of the posting station at S ?. He
was addressing his servant, a chubby young fellow, with whitish down on his chin, and little, lack-lustre eyes.
The servant, in whom everything--the turquoise ring in his ear, the streaky hair plastered with grease, and the civility of his movements--indicated a man of the new, unproved generation, glanced with an air of indulgence along the
road, and made answer:
No, sir; not in sight.
Not in sight? repeated his master.
No, sir, responded the man a second time.
His master sighed, and sat down on a little bench. We will introduce him to the reader while he sits, his feet tucked
under him, gazing thoughtfully round.
His name was Nikolai Petrovitch Kirsanov. He had twelve miles from the posting station, a fine property of two
hundred souls, or, as he expressed it--since he had arranged the division of his land with the peasants, and started a
?farm?--of nearly five thousand acres. His father, a general in the army, who served in 1812, a coarse, half-educated,
but not ill-natured man, a typical Russian, had been in harness all his life, first in command of a brigade, and then of
a division, and lived constantly in the provinces, where, by virtue of his rank, he played a fairly important part. Nikolai
Petrovitch was born in the south of Russia like his elder brother, Pavel, of whom more hereafter. He was educated at
home till he was fourteen, surrounded by cheap tutors, free-and-easy but toadying adjutants, and all the usual regimental and staff set. His mother, one of the Kolyazin family, as a girl called Agathe, but as a generals wife Agathokleya Kuzminishna Kirsanov, was one of those military ladies who take their full share of the duties and dignities of office. She wore gorgeous caps and rustling silk dresses; in church she was the first to advance to the cross; she talked
a great deal in a loud voice, let her children kiss her hand in the morning, and gave them her blessing at night--in fact,
she got everything out of life she could. Nikolai Petrovitch, as a generals son--though so far from being distinguished
by courage that he even deserved to be called ?a funk?--was intended, like his brother Pavel, to enter the army; but
he broke his leg on the very day when the news of his commission came, and, after being two months in bed, retained a slight limp to the end of his day. His father gave him up as a bad job, and let him go into the civil service. He
took him to Petersburg directly he was eighteen, and placed him in the university. His brother happened about the
same time to be made an officer in the Guards. The young men started living together in one set of rooms, under the
remote supervision of a cousin on their mothers side, Ilya Kolyazin, an official of high rank. Their father returned to
his division and his wife, and only rarely sent his sons large sheets of grey paper, scrawled over in a bold clerkly hand.
At the bottom of these sheets stood in letters, enclosed carefully in scroll-work, the words, Piotr Kirsanov, GeneralMajor. "
100,“The Gift of the Magi.”,"Henry, O",b110_TheGiftoftheMagi.txt,5,"White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick
feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers
of the lord of the flat.
For there lay The Combsthe set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window.
Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rimsjust the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They
were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of
possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.
But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: My
hair grows so fast, Jim!
And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, Oh, oh!
Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal
seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.
Isnt it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. Youll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give
me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.
Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.
Dell, said he, lets put our Christmas presents away and keep em a while. Theyre too nice to use just at present. I
sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.
The magi, as you know, were wise menwonderfully wise menwho brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They
invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the
privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two
foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last
word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and
receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi."
101,The Metamorphosis,"Kafka, Franz",b111_TheMetamorphosis.txt,5,"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted
brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely
cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.
Whats happened to me? he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small
side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all
spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine
and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up
against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.
Gregors eyes then turned to the window, and the overcast weather--he could hear raindrops hitting against the
metal window ledge--completely depressed him. How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting
all this nonsense, he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side
and in his present state could not get into that position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he
always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his
squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.

102,The Grapes of Wrath,"Steinbeck, John",b112_TheGrapesofWrath.txt,5,"The man took off his dark, stained hat and stood with a curious humility in front of the screen. Could you see your
way to sell us a loaf of bread, maam?
Mae said, This aint a grocery store. We got bread to make sanwidges.
I know, maam. His humility was insistent. We need bread and there aint nothin for quite a piece, they say.
F we sell bread we gonna run out. Maes tone was faltering.
Were hungry, the man said.
Whynt you buy a sanwidge? We got nice sanwidges, hamburgs.
Wed sure admire to do that, maam. But we cant. We got to make a dime do all of us. And he said embarrassedly,
We aint got but a little.
Mae said, You cant get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
From behind her Al growled, God Almighty, Mae, give em bread.
Well run out fore the bread truck comes.
Run out then, goddamn it, said Al. He looked sullenly down at the potato salad he was mixing.
Mae shrugged her plump shoulders and looked to the truck drivers to show them what she was up against.
She held the screen door open and the man came in, bringing a smell of sweat with him. The boys edged behind him
and they went immediately to the candy case and stared innot with craving or with hope or even with desire, but 
just with a kind of wonder that such things could be. They were alike in size and their faces were alike. One scratched
his dusty ankle with the toe nails of his other foot. The other whispered some soft message and then they straightened their arms so that their clenched fists in the overall pockets showed through the thin blue cloth.
Mae opened a drawer and took out a long waxpaper-wrapped loaf. This here is a fifteen-cent loaf.
The man put his hat back on his head. He answered with inflexible humility, Wont youcant you see your way to cut
off ten cents worth?
Al said snarlingly, Goddamn it, Mae. Give em the loaf.
The man turned toward Al. No, we want ta buy ten cents worth of it. We got it figgered awful close, mister, to get to
California.
Mae said resignedly, You can have this for ten cents.
Thatd be robbin you, maam.
Go aheadAl says to take it. She pushed the waxpapered loaf across the counter. The man took a deep leather
pouch from his rear pocket, untied the strings, and spread it open. It was heavy with silver and with greasy bills.
May soun funny to be so tight, he apologized. We got a thousan miles to go, an we don know if well make it. He
dug in the pouch with a forefinger, located a dime, and pinched in for it. When he put it down on the counter he had
a penny with it. He was about to drop the penny back into the pouch when his eye fell on the boys frozen before the
candy counter. He moved slowly down to them. He pointed in the case at big long sticks of striped peppermint. Is
them penny candy, maam?
Mae moved down and looked in. Which ones?
There, them stripy ones.
The little boys raised their eyes to her face and they stopped breathing; their mouths were partly opened, their halfnaked bodies were rigid.
Ohthem. Well, nothems two for a penny.
Well, gimme two then, maam. He placed the copper cent carefully on the counter. The boys expelled their held
breath softly. Mae held the big sticks out."
103,Fahrenheit 451,"Bradbury, Ray",b113_Fahrenheit.txt,5,"It was a pleasure to burn.
It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things
blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this
great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood
pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing
conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring
down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic
helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame
with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the
house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and
yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above
all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace,
while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and 
lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and
blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.
Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back
by flame.
He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at
himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to
sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in
the dark. It never went away, that. smile, it never ever went away, as
long as he remembered.
He hung up his black-beetle-colored helmet and shined it, he hung
his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then,
whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire
station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster
seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his
fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels
one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.
He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street
toward the subway where the silent, air-propelled train slid
soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a
great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the
suburb.
Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He
walked toward the comer, thinking little at all about nothing in
particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a
wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.
The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about
the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight
toward his house. He had felt that a moment prior to 
his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged
with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a
moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him
through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on
the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one
spot where a person's standing might raise the immediate atmosphere
ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he
made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with
perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn
before he could focus his eyes or speak.
But now, tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind,
reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper.
Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone
standing very quietly there, waiting?
He turned the corner.
The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way
as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk,
letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her
head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face
was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that
touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of
pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move
escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost
thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the
infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she
discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the
middle of the pavement waiting.
The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry
rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in 
surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and
shining and alive, that he felt he had said something quite wonderful.
But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when
she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenixdisc on his chest, he spoke again.
""Of course,"" he said, ""you're a new neighbor, aren't you?""
""And you must be""-she raised her eyes from his professional
symbols-""the fireman."" Her voice trailed off.
""How oddly you say that.""
""I'd-I'd have known it with my eyes shut,"" she said, slowly.
""What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains,"" he
laughed. ""You never wash it off completely.""
""No, you don't,"" she said, in awe.
He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for
end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once
moving herself.
""Kerosene,"" he said, because the silence had lengthened, ""is
nothing but perfume to me.""
""Does it seem like that, really?""
""Of course. Why not?""
She gave herself time to think of it. ""I don't know."" She turned to
face the sidewalk going toward their homes. ""Do you mind if I walk
back with you? I'm Clarisse McClellan.""
""Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so
late wandering around? How old are you?""
They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered
pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and
strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was
quite impossible, so late in the year.
There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as
snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working 
his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.
""Well,"" she said, ""I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the
two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say
seventeen and insane. Isn't this a nice time of night to walk? I like to
smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night,
walking, and watch the sun rise.""
They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully,
""You know, I'm not afraid of you at all.""
He was surprised. ""Why should you be?""
""So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But you're just a
man, after all...""
He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of
bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his
mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of
violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned
to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it.
It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely
comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time,
when he was a child, in a power-failure, his mother had found and lit a
last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such
illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably
around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping
that the power might not come on again too soon ....
And then Clarisse McClellan said:
""Do you mind if I ask? How long have you worked at being a
fireman?""
""Since I was twenty, ten years ago.""
""Do you ever read any of the books you bum?""
He laughed. ""That's against the law!"" 
 ""Oh. Of course.""
""It's fine work. Monday bum Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday
Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then bum the ashes. That's our official
slogan.""
They walked still further and the girl said, ""Is it true that long ago
firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?""
""No. Houses. have always been fireproof, take my word for it.""
""Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by
accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.""
He laughed.
She glanced quickly over. ""Why are you laughing?""
""I don't know."" He started to laugh again and stopped ""Why?""
""You laugh when I haven't been funny and you answer right off.
You never stop to think what I've asked you.""
He stopped walking, ""You are an odd one,"" he said, looking at her.
""Haven't you any respect?""
""I don't mean to be insulting. It's just, I love to watch people too
much, I guess.""
""Well, doesn't this mean anything to you?"" He tapped the
numerals 451 stitched on his char-colored sleeve.
""Yes,"" she whispered. She increased her pace. ""Have you ever
watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?
""You're changing the subject!""
""I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers,
because they never see them slowly,"" she said. ""If you showed a driver
a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur? That's a rosegarden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove
slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed
him for two days. Isn't that funny, and sad, too?""
""You think too many things,"" said Montag, uneasily.
""I rarely watch the 'parlor walls' or go to races or Fun Parks. So I've
lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess. Have you seen the twohundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you
know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started
rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it
would last.""
""I didn't know that!"" Montag laughed abruptly.
""Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in
the morning.""
He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and
it made him quite irritable.
""And if you look""-she nodded at the sky-""there's a man in the
moon.""
He hadn't looked for a long time.
They walked the rest of the way in silence, hers thoughtful, his a
kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her
accusing glances. When they reached her house all its lights were
blazing.
""What's going on?"" Montag had rarely seen that many house lights.
""Oh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking.
It's like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another
time-did I tell you?-for being a pedestrian. Oh, we're most peculiar.""
""But what do you talk about?""
She laughed at this. ""Good night!"" She started up her walk. Then
she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with
wonder and curiosity. ""Are you happy?"" she said.
""Am I what?"" he cried.
But she was gone-running in the moonlight. Her front door shut
gently. 
""Happy! Of all the nonsense.""
He stopped laughing.
He put his hand into the glove-hole of his front door and let it
know his touch. The front door slid open.
Of course I'm happy. What does she think? I'm not? he asked the
quiet rooms. He stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and
suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille,
something that seemed to peer down at him now. He moved his eyes
quickly away.
What a strange meeting on a strange night. He remembered
nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old
man in the park and they had talked ....
Montag shook his head. He looked at a blank wall. The girl's face
was there, really quite beautiful in memory: astonishing, in fact. She
had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark
room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see
the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second, with a
white silence and a glowing, all certainty and knowing what it has to
tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but
moving also toward a new sun.
""What?"" asked Montag of that other self, the subconscious idiot
that ran babbling at times, quite independent of will, habit, and
conscience.
He glanced back at the wall. How like a mirror, too, her face.
Impossible; for how many people did you know that refracted your
own light to you? People were more often-he searched for a simile,
found one in his work-torches, blazing away until they whiffed out.
How rarely did other people's faces take of you and throw back to you
your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought? 
What incredible power of identification the girl had; she was like
the eager watcher of a marionette show, anticipating each flicker of an
eyelid, each gesture of his hand, each flick of a finger, the moment
before it began. How long had they walked together? Three minutes?
Five? Yet how large that time seemed now. How immense a figure she
was on the stage before him; what a shadow she threw on the wall with
her slender body! He felt that if his eye itched, she might blink. And if
the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly, she would yawn long
before he would.
Why, he thought, now that I think of it, she almost seemed to be
waiting for me there, in the street, so damned late at night ... .
He opened the bedroom door.
It was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum
after the moon had set. Complete darkness, not a hint of the silver
world outside, the windows tightly shut, the chamber a tomb-world
where no sound from the great city could penetrate. The room was not
empty.
He listened.
The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical
murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The
music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune.
He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself
like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long
and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy.
He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as
the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl
had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of
going to knock on her door and ask for it back. "
104,“I Stand Here Ironing.”,"Olsen, Tillie",b114_IStandHereIroning.txt,5,"I STAND HERE IRONING
I stand here ironing, and what you asked me moves tormented back and forth with the
iron.
I wish you would manage the time to come in and talk with me about your
daughter. Im sure you can help me understand her. Shes a youngster who needs help
and whom Im deeply interested in helping.
Who needs help? Even if I came what good would it do? You think because I am
her mother I have a key, or that in some way you could use me as a key? She has lived
for nineteen years. There is all that life that has happened outside of me, beyond me.
And when is there time to remember, to sift, to weigh, to estimate, to total? I will
start and there will be an interruption and I will have to gather it all together again. Or I
will become engulfed with all I did or did not do, with what should have been and
what cannot be helped.
She was a beautiful baby. The first and only one of our five that was beautiful at
birth. You do not guess how new and uneasy her tenancy in her now-loveliness. You
did not know her all those years she was thought homely, or see her poring over her
baby pictures, making me tell her over and over how beautiful she had beenand
would be, I would tell herand was now, to the seeing eye. But the seeing eyes were
few or nonexistent. Including mine.
I nursed her. They feel thats important nowadays. I nursed all the children, but
with her, with all the fierce rigidity of first motherhood, I did like the books said.
Though her cries battered me to trembling and my breasts ached with swollenness, I
waited till the clock decreed.
Why do I put that first? I do not even know if it matters, or if it explains anything.
She was a beautiful baby. She blew shining bubbles of sound. She loved motion,
loved light, loved color and music and textures. She would lie on the floor in her blue
overalls patting the surface so hard in ecstasy her hands and feet would blur. She was a
miracle to me, but when she was eight months old I had to leave her daytimes with the
woman downstairs to whom she was no miracle at all, for I worked or looked for work
and for Emilys father, who could no longer endure (he wrote in his good-by note)
sharing want with us.
I was nineteen. It was the pre-relief, pre-WPA world of the depression. I would start
running as soon as I got off the streetcar, running up the stairs, the place smelling sour,
and awake or asleep to startle awake, when she saw me she would break into a clogged
weeping that could not be comforted, a weeping I can yet hear.
After a while I found a job hashing at night so I could be with her days, and it was
better. But it came to where I had to bring her to his family and leave her.
It took a long time to raise the money for her fare back. Then she got chicken pox
and I had to wait longer. When she finally came, I hardly knew her, walking quick and
nervous like her father, looking like her father, thin, and dressed in a shoddy red that
yellowed her skin and glared at the pock marks. All the baby loveliness gone.
She was two. Old enough for nursery school they said, and I did not know then
what I know nowthe fatigue of the long day, and the lacerations of group life in
nurseries that are only parking places for children.
Except that it would have made no difference if I had known. It was the only place
there was. It was the only way we could be together, the only way I could hold a job.
And even without knowing, I knew. I knew the teacher that was evil because all
these years it has curdled into my memory, the little boy hunched in the corner, her
rasp, why arent you outside, because Alvin hits you? thats no reason, go out
coward. I knew Emily hated it even if she did not clutch and implore dont go
Mommy like the other children, mornings.
She always had a reason why we should stay home. Momma, you look sick,
Momma. 1 feel sick. Momma, the teachers arent there today, theyre sick. Momma
there was a fire there last night. Momma its a holiday today, no school, they told me.
But never a direct protest, never rebellion. I think of our others in their three-, four-
year-oldnessthe explosions, the tempers, the denunciations, the demands and I feel
suddenly ill. I stop the ironing. What in me demanded that goodness in her? And what
was the cost, the cost to her of such goodness?
The old man living in the back once said in his gentle way: You should smile at
Emily more when you look at her. What was in my face when I looked at her? I loved
her. There were all the acts of love.
It was only with the others I remembered what he said, so that it was the face of joy,
and not of care or tightness or worry I turned to thembut never to Emily. She does
not smile easily, let alone almost always as her brothers and sisters do. Her face is
closed and somber, but when she wants, how fluid. You must have seen it in her
pantomimes, you spoke of her rare gift for comedy on the stage that rouses laughter out
of the audience so dear they applaud and applaud and do not want to let her go.
Where does it come from, that comedy? There was none of it in her when she came
back to me that second time, after I had had to send her away again. She had a new
daddy now to learn to love, and I think perhaps it was a better time. Except when we
left her alone nights, telling ourselves she was old enough.
Cant you go some other time Mommy, like tomorrow? she would ask. Will it be
just a little while youll be gone?
The time we came back, the front door open, the clock on the floor in the hall. She
rigid awake. It wasnt just a little while. I didnt cry. I called you a little, just three
times, and then I went downstairs to open the door so you could come faster. The clock
talked loud, I threw it away, it scared me what it talked.
She said the clock talked loud that night I went to the hospital to have Susan. She
was delirious with the fever that comes before red measles, but she was fully conscious
all the week I was gone and the week after we were home when she could not come
near the baby or me.
She did not get well. She stayed skeleton thin, not wanting to eat, and night after
night she had nightmares. She would call for me, and I would sleepily call back, youre
all right, darling, go to sleep, its just a dream, and if she still called, in a sterner voice,
now go to sleep Emily, theres nothing to hurt you. Twice, only twice, when 1 had to
get up for Susan anyhow, I went in to sit with her.
Now when it is too late (as if she would let me hold and comfort her like I do the
others) I get up and go to her at her moan or restless stirring. Are you awake? Can I
get you something? And the answer is always the same: No, Im all right, go back to
sleep Mother.
They persuaded me at the clinic to send her away to a convalescent home in the
country where she can have the kind of food and care you cant manage for her, and
youll be free to concentrate on the new baby. They still send children to that place. I
see pictures on the society page of sleek young women planning affairs to raise money
for it, or dancing at the affairs, or decorating Easter eggs or filling Christmas stockings
for the children.
They never have a picture of the children so I do not know if they still wear those
gigantic red bows and the ravaged looks on the every other Sunday when parents can
come to visit unless otherwise notifiedas we were notified the first six weeks.
Oh it is a handsome place, green lawns and tall trees and fluted flower beds. High
up on the balconies of each cottage the children stand, the girls in their red bows and
white dresses, the boys in white suits and giant red ties. The parents stand below
shrieking up to be heard and the children shriek down to be heard, and between them
the invisible wall Not To Be Contaminated by Parental Germs or Physical Affection.
There was a tiny girl who always stood hand in hand with Emily. Her parents never
came. One visit she was gone. They moved her to Rose Cottage, Emily shouted in
explanation. They dont like you to love anybody here.
She wrote once a week, the labored writing of a seven-year-old. I am fine. How is
the baby. If I write my leter nicly I will have a star. Love. There never was a star. We
wrote every other day, letters she could never hold or keep but only hear read once.
We simply do not have room for children to keep any personal possessions, they
patiently explained when we pieced one Sundays shrieking together to plead how
much it would mean to Emily to keep her letters and cards.
Each visit she looked frailer. She isnt eating, they told us. (They had runny eggs
for breakfast or mush with lumps, Emily said later, Id hold it in my mouth and not
swallow. Nothing ever tasted good, just when they had chicken.)
It took us eight months to get her released home, and only the fact that she gained
back so little of her seven lost pounds convinced the social worker.
I used to try to hold and love her after she came back, but her body would stay stiff,
and after a while shed push away. She ate little. Food sickened her, and I think much of
life too. Oh she had physical lightness and brightness, twinkling by on skates, bouncing
like a ball up and down up and down over the jump rope, skimming over the hill; but
these were momentary.
She fretted about her appearance, thin and dark and foreign-looking at a time when
every little girl was supposed to look or thought she should look a chubby blond replica
of Shirley Temple. The doorbell sometimes rang for her, but no one seemed to come and
play in the house or be a best friend. Maybe because we moved so much.
There was a boy she loved painfully through two school semesters. Months later
she told me how she had taken pennies from my purse to buy him candy. Licorice was
his favorite and I brought him some every day, but he still liked Jennifer bettern me.
Why Mommy why? A question I could never answer.
School was a worry to her. She was not glib or quick in a world where glibness and
quickness were easily confused with ability to learn. To her overworked and exas-
perated teachers she was an over-conscientious slow learner who kept trying to catch
up and was absent entirely too often.
I let her be absent, though sometimes the illness was imaginary. How different from
my now-strictness about attendance with the others. I wasnt working. We had a new
baby, I was home anyhow. Sometimes, after Susan grew old enough, I would keep her
home from school, too, to have them all together.
Mostly Emily had asthma, and her breathing, harsh and labored, would fill the
house with a curiously tranquil sound. I would bring the two old dresser mirrors and
her boxes of collections to her bed. She would select beads and single earrings, bottle
tops and shells, dried flowers and pebbles, old postcards and scraps, all sorts of
oddments; then she and Susan would play Kingdom, setting up landscapes and furni-
ture, peopling them with action.
Those were the only times of peaceful companionship between her and Susan. I
have edged away from it, that poisonous feeling between them, that terrible balancing
of hurts and needs I had to do between the two, and did so badly, those earlier years.
Oh there are conflicts between the others too, each one human, needing, de-
manding, hurting, takingbut only between Emily and Susan, no, Emily toward Susan
that corroding resentment. It seems so obvious on the surface, yet it is not obvious.
Susan, the second child, Susan, golden and curly haired and chubby, quick and
articulate and assured, everything in appearance and manner Emily was not; Susan, not
able to resist Emilys precious things, losing or sometimes clumsily breaking them;
Susan telling jokes and riddles to company for applause while Emily sat silent (to say to
me later: that was my riddle, Mother, I told it to Susan); Susan, who for all the five years
difference in age was just a year behind Emily in developing physically.
I am glad for that slow physical development that widened the difference between
her and her contemporaries, though she suffered over it. She was too vulnerable for that
terrible world of youthful competition, of preening and parading, of constant measure-
ing of yourself against every other, of envy, If I had that copper hair, or If I had that
skin. . .    She tormented herself enough about not looking like the others, there was
enough of the unsureness, the having to be conscious of words before you speak, the
constant caringwhat are they thinking of me? what kind of an impression am I
makingthere was enough without having it all magnified unendurably by the merci-
less physical drives.
Ronnie is calling. He is wet and I change him. It is rare there is such a cry now. That
time of motherhood is almost behind me when the ear is not ones own but must always
be racked and listening for the child cry, the child call. We sit for a while and l hold him,
looking out over the city spread in charcoal with its soft aisles of light. Shuggily he
breathes. A funny word, a family word, inherited from Emily, invented by her to say
comfort.
In this and other ways she leaves her seal, I say aloud. And startle at my saying it.
What do I mean? What did I start to gather together, to try and make coherent? I was at
the terrible, growing years. War years. I do not remember them well. I was working,
there were four smaller ones now, there was not time for her. She had to help be a
mother, and housekeeper, and shopper. She had to set her seal. Mornings of crisis and
near hysteria trying to get lunches packed, hair combed, coats and shoes found,
everyone to school or Child Care on time, the baby ready for transportation. And
always the paper scribbled on by a smaller one, the book looked at by Susan then
mislaid, the homework not done. Running out to that huge school where she was one,
she was lost, she was a drop; suffering over the unpreparedness, stammering and
unsure in her classes.
There was so little time left at night after the kids were bedded dowm She would
struggle over books, always eating (it was in those years she developed her enormous
appetite that is legendary in our family) and I would be ironing, or preparing food for
the next day, or writing V-mail to Bill, or tending the baby. Sometimes, to make me
laugh, or out of her despair, she would imitate happenings or types at school.
I think I said once: Why dont you do something like this in the school amateur
show? One morning she phoned me at work, hardly understandable through the
weeping: Mother, I did it. I won, I won; they gave me first prize; they clapped and
clapped and wouldnt let me go.
Now suddenly she was Somebody, and as imprisoned in her difference as in
anonymity.
She began to be asked to perform at other high schools, even in colleges, then at city
and state-wide affairs. The first one we went to, I only recognized her that first moment
when thin, shy, she almost drowned herself into the curtains. Then:  Was this Emily?
the control, the command, the convulsing and deadly clowning, the spell, then the
roaring, stamping audience, unwilling to let this rare and precious laughter out of their
lives.
Afterwards: You ought to do something about her with a gift like thatbut without
money or knowing how, what does one do? We have left it all to her, and the gift has as
often eddied inside, clogged and clotted, as been used and growing.
She is coming. She runs up the stairs two at a time with her light graceful step, and
I know she is happy tonight. Whatever it was that occasioned your call did not happen
today.
Arent you ever going to finish the ironing, Mother? Whistler painted his mother
in a rocker. Id have to paint mine standing over an ironing board. This is one of her
communicative nights and she tells me everything and nothing as she fixes herself a
plate of food out of the icebox.
She is so lovely. Why did you want me to come in at all? Why were you concerned?
She will find her way.
She starts up the stairs to bed. Dont get me up with the rest in the morning. But
I thought you were having midterms. Oh, those, she comes back in and says quite
lightly, in a couple of years when well all be atom-dead they wont matter a bit.
She has said it before. She believes it. But because I have been dredging the past,
and all that compounds a human being is so heavy and meaningful in me, I cannot
endure it tonight.
I will never total it all now. I will never come in to say: She was a child seldom
smiled at. Her father left me before she was a year old. I worked her first six years when
there was work, or I sent her home and to his relatives. There were years she had care
she hated. She was dark and thin and foreign-looking in a world where the prestige
went to blondness and curly hair and dimples, slow where glibness was prized. She
was a child of anxious, not proud, love. We were poor and could not afford for her the
soil of easy growth. I was a young mother, I was a distracted mother. There were the
other children pushing up, demanding. Her younger sister was all that she was not. She
did not like me to touch her. She kept too much in herself, her life was such she had to
keep too much in herself. My wisdom came too late. She has much in her and probably
nothing will come of it. She is a child of her age, of depression, of war, of fear.
Let her be. So all that is in her will not bloombut in how many does it? There is
still enough left to live by. Only help her to believehelp make it so there is cause for
her to believe that she is more than this dress on the ironing board, helpless before the
iron."
105,Things Fall Apart,"Achebe, Chinua",b115_ThingsFallApart.txt,5,"Okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even beyond. His fame rested on solid personal achievements. As a young man of eighteen he had brought honor to his village by throwing Amalinze the Cat. Amalinze was
the great wrestler who for seven years was unbeaten, from Umuofia to Mbaino. He was called the Cat because his
back would never touch the earth. It was this man that Okonkwo threw in a fight which the old men agreed was one
of the fiercest since the founder of their town engaged a spirit of the wild for seven days and seven nights.
The drums beat and the flutes sang and the spectators held their breath. Amalinze was a wily craftsman, but Okonkwo was as slippery as a fish in water. Every nerve and every muscle stood out on their arms, on their backs and their
thighs, and one almost heard them stretching to breaking point. In the end Okonkwo threw the Cat.
That was many years ago, twenty years or more, and during this time Okonkwos fame had grown like a bush-fire in
the harmattan. He was tall and huge, and his bushy eyebrows and wide nose gave him a very severe look. He breathed
heavily, and it was said that, when he slept, his wives and children in their houses could hear him breathe. When he
walked, his heels hardly touched the ground and he seemed to walk on springs, as if he was going to pounce on
somebody. And he did pounce on people quite often. He had a slight stammer and whenever he was angry and could
not get his words out quickly enough, he would use his fists. He had no patience with unsuccessful men. He had had
no patience with his father.
Unoka, for that was his fathers name, had died ten years ago. In his day he was lazy and improvident and was quite
incapable of thinking about tomorrow. If any money came his way, and it seldom did, he immediately bought gourds
of palm-wine, called round his neighbors and made merry. He always said that whenever he saw a dead mans mouth
he saw the folly of not eating what one had in ones lifetime. Unoka was, of course, a debtor, and he owed every
neighbor some money, from a few cowries to quite substantial amounts.
He was tall but very thin and had a slight stoop. He wore a haggard and mournful look except when he was drinking
or playing on his flute. He was very good on his flute, and his happiest moments were the two or three moons after
the harvest when the village musicians brought down their instruments, hung above the fireplace. Unoka would play
with them, his face beaming with blessedness and peace. Sometimes another village would ask Unokas band and
their dancing egwugwu to come and stay with them and teach them their tunes. They would go to such hosts for as
long as three or four markets, making music and feasting. Unoka loved the good fare and the good fellowship, and he
loved this season of the year, when the rains had stopped and the sun rose every morning with dazzling beauty. And
it was not too hot either, because the cold and dry harmattan wind was blowing down from the north. Some years the
harmattan was very severe and a dense haze hung on the atmosphere. Old men and children would then sit round log
fires, warming their bodies. Unoka loved it all, and he loved the first kites that returned with the dry season, and the
children who sang songs of welcome to them. He would remember his own childhood, how he had often wandered
around looking for a kite sailing leisurely against the blue sky. As soon as he found one he would sing with his whole
being, welcoming it back from its long, long journey, and asking it if it had brought home any lengths of cloth. "
106,To Kill A Mockingbird,"Lee, Harper",b116_ToKillAMockingbird.txt,5,"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the
elbow. When it healed, and Jems fears of never being able to play football were
assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was
somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand
was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldnt have
cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.
When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we
sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells
started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before
that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea
of making Boo Radley come out.
I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew
Jackson. If General Jackson hadnt run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch
would never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadnt?

We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted
Atticus. Our father said we were both right.
Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that
we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had
was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was
exceeded only by his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the
persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more
liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way
across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica, thence to Mobile, and up
the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesleys strictures on the use of many words
in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit
he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory
of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten
his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and
with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some
forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find
a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to
an impressive age and died rich.
It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simons homestead,
Finchs Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient:
modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless
produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles
of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.
Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North
and the South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet
the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth
century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his
younger brother went to Boston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the
Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most
of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.
When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his
practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, was the county

seat of Maycomb County. Atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more
than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His
first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail.
Atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead
Guilty to second-degree murder and escape with their lives, but they were
Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The
Haverfords had dispatched Maycombs leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding
arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent enough to

do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-
coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in

pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus
could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was
probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of
criminal law.
During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than
anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers
education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to
study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting
Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked
Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they
knew him, and because of Simon Finchs industry, Atticus was related by blood
or marriage to nearly every family in the town.

Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In
rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the
courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog
suffered on a summers day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in
the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Mens stiff collars wilted by
nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-oclock naps,
and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.
People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of
the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four

hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go,
nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries
of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people:
Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.
We lived on the main residential street in town Atticus, Jem and I, plus
Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us,
read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.
Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was
nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She
was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldnt behave as
well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasnt
ready to come. Our battles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won,
mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem
was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember.
Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham
from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state
legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was
the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two
years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her
family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play
by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to
bother him.
When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries
(within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house
two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We
were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an
unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for
days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell.
That was the summer Dill came to us.
Early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard, Jem and
I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverfords collard patch. We went

to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy Miss Rachels rat terrier was
expecting instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he
wasnt much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:
Hey.
Hey yourself, said Jem pleasantly.
Im Charles Baker Harris, he said. I can read.
So what? I said.
I just thought youd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin I
can do it...
How old are you, asked Jem, four-and-a-half?
Goin on seven.
Shoot no wonder, then, said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. Scout yonders
been readin ever since she was born, and she aint even started to school yet. You
look right puny for goin on seven.
Im little but Im old, he said.
Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. Why dont you come over,
Charles Baker Harris? he said. Lord, what a name.
s not any funniern yours. Aunt Rachel says your names Jeremy Atticus Finch.
Jem scowled. Im big enough to fit mine, he said. Your names longern you
are. Bet its a foot longer.
Folks call me Dill, said Dill, struggling under the fence.
Do better if you go over it instead of under it, I said. Whered you come from?
Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt,
Miss Rachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on.
His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a
photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and
won five dollars. She gave the money to Dill, who went to the picture show
twenty times on it.
Dont have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse
sometimes, said Jem. Ever see anything good?

Dill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning
of respect. Tell it to us, he said.
Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair
was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but
I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and
darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the
center of his forehead.
When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than
the book, I asked Dill where his father was: You aint said anything about him.
I havent got one.
Is he dead?
No...
Then if hes not dead youve got one, havent you?
Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and
found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine
contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin
chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas
based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs.
In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character parts formerly
thrust upon me the ape in Tarzan, Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys, Mr. Damon
in Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed
with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies.
But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions,
and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.
The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it
drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on
the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm
around the fat pole, staring and wondering.
The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, one
faced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low,
was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago

darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles
drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains
of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard a swept yard that was never
swept where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.
Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and
I had never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down,
and peeped in windows. When peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was
because he had breathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in
Maycomb were his work. Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid
nocturnal events: peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated;
although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in
Barkers Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their
initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut
across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school
grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall
pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the
children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a
lost ball and no questions asked.
The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The
Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection
unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycombs principal
recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street
for a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a
missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and
came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the
neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr.
Radley made his living Jem said he bought cotton, a polite term for doing
nothingbut Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long
as anybody could remember.
The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another
thing alien to Maycombs ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather
only. Of all days Sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore
corsets, men wore coats, children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps

and call, He-y, of a Sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did.
The Radley house had no screen doors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any;
Atticus said yes, but before I was born.
According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his
teens he became acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an
enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and
they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but
enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they
hung around the barbershop; they rode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and
went to the picture show; they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling
hell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; they experimented with stumphole
whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tell Mr. Radley that his boy
was in with the wrong crowd.
One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square
in a borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycombs ancient beadle, Mr. Conner,
and locked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to
be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he
was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it, so the boys came
before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace,
assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and
hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge;
Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard
them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where
boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and
decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was.
If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no
further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radleys word was his bond, the judge was
glad to do so.
The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary
education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through
engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on
weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radleys boy was not seen again for

fifteen years.
But there came a day, barely within Jems memory, when Boo Radley was heard
from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked
much about the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticuss only answer
was for him to mind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a
right to; but when it happened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, Mm,
mm, mm.
So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, a
neighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss
Stephanie, Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The
Maycomb Tribune to paste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr.
Radley passed by, Boo drove the scissors into his parents leg, pulled them out,
wiped them on his pants, and resumed his activities.
Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but
when the sheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the
Tribune. He was thirty-three years old then.
Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum,
when it was suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo
wasnt crazy, he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr.
Radley conceded, but insisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not
a criminal. The sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so
Boo was locked in the courthouse basement.
Boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jems memory.
Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he
didnt take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could
not live forever on the bounty of the county.
Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of
sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the
time. Atticus said no, it wasnt that sort of thing, that there were other ways of
making people into ghosts.
My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk
to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I

would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with
colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp
and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie
Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we
believed her, because Mr. Radleys posture was ramrod straight.
He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say,
Good morning, sir, and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radleys elder son lived
in Pensacola; he came home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we
ever saw enter or leave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home,
people said the house died.
But there came a day when Atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise
in the yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a
sound out of us. Mr. Radley was dying.
He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the
Radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back
street. Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the
Radleys every time he called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last
the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch
when Mr. Radley made his final journey past our house.
There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into, murmured Calpurnia,
and she spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for
Calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.
The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out,
but it had another think coming: Boos elder brother returned from Pensacola and
took Mr. Radleys place. The only difference between him and his father was
their ages. Jem said Mr. Nathan Radley bought cotton, too. Mr. Nathan would
speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him
coming from town with a magazine in his hand.
The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer
he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.
Wonder what he does in there, he would murmur. Looks like hed just stick
his head out the door.

Jem said, He goes out, all right, when its pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford
said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight
through the window at her... said his head was like a skull lookin at her. Aint
you ever waked up at night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this- Jem slid his
feet through the gravel. Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at
night? Ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin, and one night I heard
him scratching on the back screen, but he was gone time Atticus got there.
Wonder what he looks like? said Dill.
Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall,
judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch,
thats why his hands were bloodstainedif you ate an animal raw, you could
never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face;
what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most
of the time.
Lets try to make him come out, said Dill. Id like to see what he looks like.
Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock
on the front door.
Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against two
Tom Swifts that Jem wouldnt get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life,
Jem had never declined a dare.
Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head,
for Dill wore him down easily: Youre scared, Dill said, the first day. Aint
scared, just respectful, Jem said. The next day Dill said, Youre too scared even
to put your big toe in the front yard. Jem said he reckoned he wasnt, hed passed
the Radley Place every school day of his life.
Always runnin, I said.
But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly
werent as afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that hed never seen such scary folks
as the ones in Maycomb.
This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leaned
against the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.

I hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one, Dill
Harris, said Jem, when we joined him. Dont blame me when he gouges your
eyes out. You started it, remember.
Youre still scared, murmured Dill patiently.
Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything: Its
just that I cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us.
Besides, Jem had his little sister to think of.
When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the
time I dared him to jump off the top of the house: If I got killed, whatd become
of you? he asked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility
left him until confronted by the Radley Place.
You gonna run out on a dare? asked Dill. If you are, then-
Dill, you have to think about these things, Jem said. Lemme think a minute...
its sort of like making a turtle come out...
Hows that? asked Dill.
Strike a match under him.
I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him.
Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.
Aint hateful, just persuades hims not like youd chunk him in the fire, Jem
growled.
How do you know a match dont hurt him?
Turtles cant feel, stupid, said Jem.
Were you ever a turtle, huh?
My stars, Dill! Now lemme think... reckon we can rock him...
Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: I wont say you
ran out on a dare an Ill swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the
house.
Jem brightened. Touch the house, that all?
Dill nodded.
Sure thats all, now? I dont want you hollerin something different the minute I

get back.
Yeah, thats all, said Dill. Hell probably come out after you when he sees you
in the yard, then Scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell
him we aint gonna hurt him.
We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house,
and stopped at the gate.
Well go on, said Dill, Scout and mes right behind you.
Im going, said Jem, dont hurry me.
He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as
if deciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head.
Then I sneered at him.
Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his
palm and ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and
I followed on his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked
back.
The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street we
thought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement,
and the house was still."
107,The Killer Angels,"Shaara, Michael",b117_TheKillerAngels.txt,5,". . . have no doubt, Fremantle was saying, that General Lee shall become the worlds foremost authority on military
matters when this war is over, which would appear now to be only a matter of days, or at most a few weeks. I suspect
all Europe will be turning to him for lessons.
Lessons?
I have been thinking, I must confess, of setting some brief thoughts to paper, Fremantle announced gravely. Some
brief remarks of my own, appended to an account of this battle, and perhaps others this army has fought. Some notes
as to tactics.
Tactics?
General Lees various stratagems will be most instructive, most illuminating. I wonder, sir, if I might enlist your aid in
this, ah, endeavor. As one most closely concerned? That is, to be brief, may I come to you when in need?
Sure, Longstreet said. Tactics? He chuckled. The tactics were simple: find the enemy, fight him. He shook his head,
snorting. Fremantle spoke softly, in tones of awe.
One would not think of General Lee, now that one has met him, now that one has looked him, so to speak, in the eye,
as it were, one would not think him, you know, to be such a devious man.
Devious? Longstreet swung to stare at him, aghast.
Oh my word, Fremantle went on devoutly, but hes a tricky one. The Old Gray Fox, as they say. Charming phrase.
American to the hilt.
Devious? Longstreet stopped dead in the road. Devious. He laughed aloud. Fremantle stared an owlish stare.
Why, Colonel, bless your soul, there aint a devious bone in Robert Lees body, dont you know that?"

America was where all my mothers hopes lay. She had come here in 1949 after losing everything in China: her mother

We didnt immediately pick the right kind of prodigy. At first my mother thought I could be a Chinese Shirley Temple.

109,In the Time of the Butterflies,"Álvarez, Julia",b119_IntheTimeoftheButterflies.txt,5,"She remembers a clear moonlit night before the future began. They are sitting in the cool darkness under the anacahuita tree in the front yard, in the rockers, telling stories, drinking guanabana juice. Good for the nerves, Mam always
says.
Theyre all there, Mam, Pap, Patria-Minerva-Ded. Bang-bang-bang, their father likes to joke, aiming a pistol finger
at each one, as if he were shooting them, not boasting about having sired them, Three girls, each born within a year of
each other! And then, nine years later, Maria Teresa, his final desperate attempt at a boy misfiring.
Their father has his slippers on, one foot hooked behind the other. Every once in a while Ded hears the clink of the
rum bottle against the rim of his glass.
Many a night, and this night is no different, a shy voice calls out of the darkness, begging their pardon. Could they
spare a calmante for a sick child out of their stock of kindness? Would they have some tobacco for a tired old man
who spent the day grating yucca?
Their father gets up, swaying a little with drink and tiredness, and opens up the store. The campesino goes off with his
medicine, a couple of cigars, a few mints for the godchildren. Ded tells her father that she doesnt know how they do
as well as they do, the way he gives everything away. But her father just puts his arm around her, and says, Ay, Ded,
thats why I have you. Every soft foot needs a hard shoe.
Shell bury us all, her father adds, laughing, in silk and pearls. Ded hears again the clink of the rum bottle. Yes, for
sure, our Ded here is going to be the millionaire in the family."
110,The Book Thief,"Zusak, Marcus",b120_TheBookThief.txt,5,"The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and stirring. In some places it was burned. There were
black crumbs, and pepper, streaked amongst the redness.
Earlier, kids had been playing hopscotch there, on the street that looked like oil-stained pages. When I arrived I could
still hear the echoes. The feet tapping the road. The children-voices laughing, and the smiles like salt, but decaying
fast.
Then, bombs.
This time, everything was too late.
The sirens. The cuckoo shrieks in the radio. All too late.
Within minutes, mounds of concrete and earth were stacked and piled. The streets were ruptured veins. Blood
streamed till it was dried on the road, and the bodies were stuck there, like driftwood after the flood.
They were glued down, every last one of them. A packet of souls.
Was it fate?
Misfortune?
Is that what glued them down like that?
Of course not.
Lets not be stupid.
It probably had more to do with the hurled bombs, thrown down by humans hiding in the clouds.
For hours, the sky remained a devastating, home-cooked red. The small German town had been flung apart
one more time. Snowflakes of ash fell so lovelily you were tempted to stretch out your tongue to catch them, taste
them. Only, they would have scorched your lips. They would have cooked your mouth.
Clearly, I see it.
I was just about to leave when I found her kneeling there.
A mountain range of rubble was written, designed, erected around her. She was clutching at a book.
Apart from everything else, the book thief wanted desperately to go back to the basement, to write, or read through
her story one last time. In hindsight, I see it so obviously on her face. She was dying for itthe safety, the home of it
but she could not move. Also, the basement no longer existed. It was part of the mangled landscape."
111,“Speech to the Second Virginia Convention.”,"Henry, Patrick",b121_SpeechtotheSecondVirginiaConvention.txt,5,"MR. PRESIDENT: No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy
gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and,
therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do, opinions of a character
very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely, and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The
question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than
a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the
debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to
God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence, I should consider
myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the majesty of heaven, which I
revere above all earthly kings.
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful
truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a
great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and,
having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of
spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of
the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British
ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves,
and the House? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove
a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of
our petition comports with these war-like preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and
armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that
force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and
subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask, gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any
enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They
are meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which
the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we
have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held
the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble
supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive
ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have
petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted;
our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we
have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond
hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free, if we mean to preserve
inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending, if we mean not basely to abandon
the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon
until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to
arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left us!
They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger?
Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be
stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall
have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature
hath placed in our power. Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that
which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our 
battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our
battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have
no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in
submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace but there is no peace. The war is actually
begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are
already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear,
or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!"
112,“Farewell Address.”,"Washington, George",b122_FarewellAddress.txt,5,"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free
people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most
baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation
and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and
even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to
become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.
The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with
them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled
with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very
remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to
our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.
Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people under
an efficient government. the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we
may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected;
when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us
provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.
Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by
interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European
ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?
It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we
are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.
I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it,
therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would
be unwise to extend them. "
113,“Gettysburg Address.”,"Lincoln, Abraham",b123_GettysburgAddress.txt,5,"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final
resting-place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.
But in a large sense we cannot dedicate,we cannot consecrate,we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will little
note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is, rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that
cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that Government of the people,
by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
114,“Second Inaugural Address.”,"Lincoln, Abraham",b124_SecondInauguralAddress.txt,5,"Fellow-Countrymen:
At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address
than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper.
Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point
and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is
new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public
as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.
All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war—seeking to
dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war
rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.
One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the
southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents
would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial
enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.
Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease.
Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray
to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask
a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be
not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has
His own purposes. “Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to
that man by whom the offense cometh.” If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in
the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to
remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense
came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always
ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.
Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as
was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”
With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive
on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for
his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

115,“State of the Union Address.”,"Roosevelt, Franklin Delano",b125_StateoftheUnionAddress.txt,5,"For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy. The basic things expected
by our people of their political and economic systems are simple. They are:
Equality of opportunity for youth and for others.
Jobs for those who can work.
Security for those who need it.
The ending of special privilege for the few.
The preservation of civil liberties for all.
The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.
These are the simple, basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our
modern world. The inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree
to which they fulfill these expectations.
Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement. As examples:
We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.
We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care.
We should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it.
I have called for personal sacrifice. I am assured of the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call.
A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes. In my Budget Message I shall recommend that a
greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying today. No person should
try, or be allowed, to get rich out of this program; and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay
should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation.
If the Congress maintains these principles, the voters, putting patriotism ahead of pocketbooks, will give you their
applause.
In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human
freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world.
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want—which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world."
116,“I Am an American Day Address.”,"Hand, Learned",b126_IAmanAmericanDayAddress.txt,5,"We have gathered here to affirm a faith, a faith in a common purpose, a common conviction, a common devotion.
Some of us have chosen America as the land of our adoption; the rest have come from those who did the same. For
this reason we have some right to consider ourselves a picked group, a group of those who had the courage to break
from the past and brave the dangers and the loneliness of a strange land. What was the object that nerved us, or
those who went before us, to this choice? We sought liberty; freedom from oppression, freedom from want, freedom
to be ourselves. This we then sought; this we now believe that we are by way of winning. What do we mean when
we say that first of all we seek liberty? I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much upon constitutions, upon laws and upon courts. These are false hopes; believe me, these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of
men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. While it lies there
it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it. And what is this liberty which must lie in the hearts of men and
women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will; it is not freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of liberty, and
leads straight to its overthrow. A society in which men recognize no check upon their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few; as we have learned to our sorrow.
What then is the spirit of liberty? I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit
which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the mind of other men
and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of
liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near
two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned but never quite forgotten; that there may be
a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest. "
117,“Remarks to the Senate in Support of a Declaration of Conscience.”,"Smith, Margaret Chase",b127_RemarkstotheSenatein.txt,5,"Mr. President:
I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. It is a condition that
comes from the lack of effective leadership in either the Legislative Branch or the Executive Branch of our Government.
That leadership is so lacking that serious and responsible proposals are being made that national advisory commissions be appointed to provide such critically needed leadership.
I speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has already been done with irresponsible words of bitterness
and selfish political opportunism. I speak as briefly as possible because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence. I speak simply and briefly in the hope that my words will be taken to heart.
I speak as a Republican. I speak as a woman. I speak as a United States Senator. I speak as an American.
The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative body in the world. But
recently that deliberative character has too often been debased to the level of a forum of hate and character assassination sheltered by the shield of congressional immunity.
It is ironical that we Senators can in debate in the Senate directly or indirectly, by any form of words, impute to any
American who is not a Senator any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming an Americanand without that
non-Senator American having any legal redress against usyet if we say the same thing in the Senate about our colleagues we can be stopped on the grounds of being out of order.
It is strange that we can verbally attack anyone else without restraint and with full protection and yet we hold ourselves above the same type of criticism here on the Senate Floor. Surely the United States Senate is big enough to
take self-criticism and self-appraisal. Surely we should be able to take the same kind of character attacks that we
dish out to outsiders.
I think that it is high time for the United States Senate and its members to do some soul-searchingfor us to weigh
our conscienceson the manner in which we are performing our duty to the people of Americaon the manner in
which we are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges.
I think that it is high time that we remembered that we have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution. I think that
it is high time that we remembered that the Constitution, as amended, speaks not only of the freedom of speech but
also of trial by jury instead of trial by accusation.
Whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a character prosecution in the Senate, there is little practical distinction when the life of a person has been ruined.
Those of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in making character assassinations are all too frequently those
who, by our own words and acts, ignore some of the basic principles of Americanism:
 The right to criticize;
 The right to hold unpopular beliefs;
 The right to protest;
 The right of independent thought.
The exercise of these rights should not cost one single American citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood nor
should he be in danger of losing his reputation or livelihood merely because he happens to know someone who holds
unpopular beliefs. Who of us doesnt? Otherwise none of us could call our souls our own. Otherwise thought control
would have set in.
The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their minds lest they be politically smeared as Communists or Fascists by their opponents. Freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America. It has been so
abused by some that it is not exercised by others.
The American people are sick and tired of seeing innocent people smeared and guilty people whitewashed. But there
have been enough proved cases, such as the Amerasia case, the Hiss case, the Coplon case, the Gold case, to cause
the nationwide distrust and strong suspicion that there may be something to the unproved, sensational accusations.
I doubt if the Republican Party couldsimply because I dont believe the American people will uphold any political
party that puts political exploitation above national interest. Surely we Republicans arent that desperate for victory.
I dont want to see the Republican Party win that way. While it might be a fleeting victory for the Republican Party, it
would be a more lasting defeat for the American people. Surely it would ultimately be suicide for the Republican Party and the two-party system that has protected our American liberties from the dictatorship of a one party system.
As members of the Minority Party, we do not have the primary authority to formulate the policy of our Government.
But we do have the responsibility of rendering constructive criticism, of clarifying issues, of allaying fears by acting as 
responsible citizens.
As a woman, I wonder how the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters feel about the way in which members of their
families have been politically mangled in the Senate debateand I use the word debate advisedly.
As a United States Senator, I am not proud of the way in which the Senate has been made a publicity platform for irresponsible sensationalism. I am not proud of the reckless abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from
the side of the aisle. I am not proud of the obviously staged, undignified countercharges that have been attempted in
retaliation from the other side of the aisle.
I dont like the way the Senate has been made a rendezvous for vilification, for selfish political gain at the sacrifice of
individual reputations and national unity. I am not proud of the way we smear outsiders from the Floor of the Senate
and hide behind the cloak of congressional immunity and still place ourselves beyond criticism on the Floor of the
Senate.
As an American, I am shocked at the way Republicans and Democrats alike are playing directly into the Communist
design of confuse, divide, and conquer. As an American, I dont want a Democratic Administration whitewash or
cover-up any more than a want a Republican smear or witch hunt.
As an American, I condemn a Republican Fascist just as much I condemn a Democratic Communist. I condemn a
Democrat Fascist just as much as I condemn a Republican Communist. They are equally dangerous to you and me
and to our country. As an American, I want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we
fought the enemy instead of ourselves.
It is with these thoughts that I have drafted what I call a Declaration of Conscience. I am gratified that Senator
Tobey, Senator Aiken, Senator Morse, Senator Ives, Senator Thye, and Senator Hendrickson have concurred in that
declaration and have authorized me to announce their concurrence."
118,“Letter from Birmingham Jail.”,"Martin Luther King, Jr  ",b128_LetterfromBirminghamJail.txt,5,"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:
While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities
unwise and untimely. Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the
course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good
will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statements in what I hope will be
patient and reasonable terms.
I think I should indicate why I am here In Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues
against outsiders coming in. I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eightyfive affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights.
Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here
in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary.
We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my
staff, am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here.
But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left
their villages and carried their thus saith the Lord far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the
Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman
world, so am I. compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly
respond to the Macedonian call for aid.
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not
be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught
in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial outside agitator idea. Anyone who lives inside
the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. "
119," “I Have a Dream: Address Delivered at the March on Washington, D.C., for Civil Rights on August 28, 1963.”","Martin Luther King, Jr",b129_IHaveaDreamAddress.txt,5,"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree
came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak
to end the long night of captivity.
But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly
crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the
midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself
an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.
In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution
and the declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all
men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred
obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."" But we refuse to believe that the bank of
justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this
check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind
America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the
time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of
God's children. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer
of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a
beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to
business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will
continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of
gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness
and hatred.
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical
violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has
engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here
today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil
rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels
of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We
can never be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are
not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow cells. Some of
you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality.
You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities,
knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the
American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men
are created equal.""
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down
together at a table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their
character.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will
be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as
sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the
crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
This is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of
hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be
able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one
day.
This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, ""My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.""
And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring
from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of California!
But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!
Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that
day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual, ""Free at last! free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"""
120,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,"Angelou, Maya",b130_IKnowWhytheCagedBirdSings.txt,5,"She said she was going to give me some books and that I not only must read them, I must read them aloud. She suggested that I try to make a sentence sound in as many different ways as possible.
Ill accept no excuse if you return a book to me that has been badly handled. My imagination boggled at the punishment I would deserve if in fact I did abuse a book of Mrs. Flowers. Death would be too kind and brief.
The odors in the house surprised me. Somehow I had never connected Mrs. Flowers with food or eating or any other
common experience of common people. There must have been an outhouse, too, but my mind never recorded it.
The sweet scent of vanilla had met us as she opened the door.
I made tea cookies this morning. You see, I had planned to invite you for cookies and lemonade so we could have this
little chat. The lemonade is in the icebox.
It followed that Mrs. Flowers would have ice on an ordinary day, when most families in our town bought ice late on
Saturdays only a few times during the summer to be used in the wooden ice-cream freezers.
She took the bags from me and disappeared through the kitchen door. I looked around the room that I had never in
my wildest fantasies imagined I would see. Browned photographs leered or threatened from the walls and the white,
freshly done curtains pushed against themselves and against the wind. I wanted to gobble up the room entire and
take it to Bailey, who would help me analyze and enjoy it."
121,"“Hope, Despair and Memory.”","Wiesel, Elie",b131_HopeDespairandMemory.txt,5,"It is with a profound sense of humility that I accept the honor - the highest there is - that you have chosen to bestow
upon me. I know your choice transcends my person.
Do I have the right to represent the multitudes who have perished? Do I have the right to accept this great honor on
their behalf? I do not. No one may speak for the dead, no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions. And
yet, I sense their presence. I always do - and at this moment more than ever. The presence of my parents, that of my
little sister. The presence of my teachers, my friends, my companions...
This honor belongs to all the survivors and their children and, through us to the Jewish people with whose destiny I
have always identified.
I remember: it happened yesterday, or eternities ago. A young Jewish boy discovered the Kingdom of Night. I remember his bewilderment, I remember his anguish. It all happened so fast. The ghetto. The deportation. The sealed cattle
car. The fiery altar upon which the history of our people and the future of mankind were meant to be sacrificed.
I remember he asked his father: “Can this be true? This is the twentieth century, not the Middle Ages. Who would allow such crimes to be committed? How could the world remain silent?”
And now the boy is turning to me. “Tell me,” he asks, “what have you done with my future, what have you done with
your life?” And I tell him that I have tried. That I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who
would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.
And then I explain to him how naïve we were, that the world did know and remained silent. And that is why I swore
never to be silent whenever wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must take sides. Neutrality
helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must
interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities
become irrelevant."
122,“Address to Students at Moscow State University.”,"Reagan, Ronald",b132_AddresstoStudents.txt,5,"But progress is not foreordained. The key is freedomfreedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication. The renowned scientist, scholar, and founding father of this university, Mikhail Lomonosov, knew that. It
is common knowledge, he said, that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid, particularly once the
yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy. 
The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with the courage to take risks and faith
enough to brave the unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the
economic growth in the United States. They are the prime movers of the technological revolution. In fact, one of the
largest personal computer firms in the United States was started by two college students, no older than you, in the
garage behind their home. Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste. What of all the entrepreneurs that fail? Well, many do, particularly the successful ones; often
several times. And if you ask them the secret of their success, theyll tell you its all that they learned in their struggles
along the way; yes, its what they learned from failing. Like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the
truth, experience is the greatest teacher. []
We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom. In fact, its something of a national pastime. Every 4 years the
American people choose a new President, and 1988 is one of those years. At one point there were 13 major candidates
running in the two major parties, not to mention all the others, including the Socialist and Libertarian candidatesall
trying to get my job.
About 1,000 local television stations, 8,500 radio stations, and 1,700 daily newspaperseach one an independent, private enterprise, fiercely independent of the Governmentreport on the candidates, grill them in interviews, and bring
them together for debates. In the end, the people vote; they decide who will be the next President.
But freedom doesnt begin or end with elections. Go to any American town, to take just an example, and youll see
dozens of churches, representing many different beliefsin many places, synagogues and mosquesand youll see
families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together. Go into any schoolroom, and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rightsamong them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happinessthat no government can justly deny; the guarantees in
their Constitution for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion.
Go into any courtroom, and there will preside an independent judge, beholden to no government power. There every
defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and womencommon citizens; they are the
ones, the only ones, who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence. In that court, the accused is innocent
until proven guilty, and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused.
Go to any university campus, and there youll find an open, sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American
society and what can be done to correct them. Turn on the television, and youll see the legislature conducting the
business of government right there before the camera, debating and voting on the legislation that will become the
law of the land. March in any demonstration, and there are many of them; the peoples right of assembly is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the police. Go into any union hall, where the members know their right to
strike is protected by law.
But freedom is more even than this. Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things.
It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings
and seek solutions. It is the right to put forth an idea, scoffed at by the experts, and watch it catch fire among the
people. It is the right to dreamto follow your dream or stick to your conscience, even if youre the only one in a sea
of doubters. Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on
the truth, but that every individual life is infinitely precious, that every one of us put on this world has been put there
for a reason and has something to offer."
123,“A Quilt of a Country.”,"Quindlen, Anna",b133_AQuiltofaCountry.txt,5,"America is an improbable idea. A mongrel nation built of ever-changing disparate parts, it is held together by a notion, the notion that all men are created equal, though everyone knows that most men consider themselves better than someone. ""Of all the nations in the world, the United States was built in nobody's image,"" the historian Daniel Boorstin wrote. That's because it was built of bits and pieces that seem discordant, like the crazy quilts that have been one of its great folk-art forms, velvet and calico and checks and brocades. Out of many, one. That is the ideal.

The reality is often quite different, a great national striving consisting frequently of failure. Many of the oft-told stories of the most pluralistic nation on earth are stories not of tolerance, but of bigotry. Slavery and sweatshops, the burning of crosses and the ostracism of the other. Children learn in social-studies class and in the news of the lynching of blacks, the denial of rights to women, the murders of gay men. It is difficult to know how to convince them that this amounts to ""crown thy good with brotherhood,"" that amid all the failures is something spectacularly successful. Perhaps they understand it at this moment, when enormous tragedy, as it so often does, demands a time of reflection on enormous blessings.

This is a nation founded on a conundrum, what Mario Cuomo has characterized as ""community added to individualism."" These two are our defining ideals; they are also in constant conflict. Historians today bemoan the ascendancy of a kind of prideful apartheid in America, saying that the clinging to ethnicity, in background and custom, has undermined the concept of unity. These historians must have forgotten the past, or have gilded it. The New York of my children is no more Balkanized, probably less so, than the Philadelphia of my father, in which Jewish boys would walk several blocks out of their way to avoid the Irish divide of Chester Avenue. (I was the product of a mixed marriage, across barely bridgeable lines: an Italian girl, an Irish boy. How quaint it seems now, how incendiary then.) The Brooklyn of Francie Nolan's famous tree, the Newark of which Portnoy complained, even the uninflected WASP suburbs of Cheever's characters: they are ghettos, pure and simple. Do the Cambodians and the Mexicans in California coexist less easily today than did the Irish and Italians of Massachusetts a century ago? You know the answer.

What is the point of this splintered whole? What is the point of a nation in which Arab cabbies chauffeur Jewish passengers through the streets of New York--and in which Jewish cabbies chauffeur Arab passengers, too, and yet speak in theory of hatred, one for the other? What is the point of a nation in which one part seems to be always on the verge of fisticuffs with another, blacks and whites, gays and straights, left and right, Pole and Chinese and Puerto Rican and Slovenian? Other countries with such divisions have in fact divided into new nations with new names, but not this one, impossibly interwoven even in its hostilities.

Once these disparate parts were held together by a common enemy, by the fault lines of world wars and the electrified fence of communism."
124,Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West,"Brown, Dee",b134_BuryMyHeartatWoundedKnee.txt,5,"The decade following establishment of the permanent Indian frontier was a bad time for the eastern tribes. The
great Cherokee nation had survived more than a hundred years of the white mans wars, diseases, and whiskey, but
now it was to be blotted out. Because the Cherokees numbered several thousands, their removal to the West was
planned to be in gradual stages, but the discovery of Appalachian gold within their territory brought on a clamor for
their immediate wholesale exodus. During the autumn of 1838, General Winfield Scotts soldiers rounded them up and
concentrated them into camps. (A few hundred escaped to the Smoky Mountains and many years later where given
a small reservation in North Carolina.) From the prison camps they were started westward to Indian Territory. On the
long winter trek, one of every four Cherokees died from the cold, hunger, or disease. They called the march their trail
of tears. The Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles also gave up their homelands in the South. In the North,
surviving remnants of the Shawnees, Miamis, Ottawas, Hurons, Delawares, and many other once mighty tribes walked
or traveled by horseback and wagon beyond the Mississippi, carrying their shabby goods, their rusty farming tools,
and bags of seed corn. All of them arrived as refugees, poor relations, in the country of the proud and free Plains
Indians.
Scarcely were the refugees settled behind the security of the permanent Indian frontier when soldiers began marching westward through Indian country. The white men of the United Stateswho talked so much of peace but rarely
seemed to practice itwere marching to war with the white men who had conquered the Indians of Mexico. When the
war with Mexico ended in 1847, the United States took possession of a vast expanse of territory reaching from Texas
to California. All of it was west of the permanent Indian frontier.

125,Son of the Morning Star: Custer and the Little Bighorn,"Connell, Evan S",b135_SonoftheMorningStar.txt,5,"Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull.
In English this name sounds a little absurd, and to whites of the nineteenth century is was still more so; they alluded
to him as Slightly Recumbent Gentleman Cow.
Exact Translation from the Sioux is impossible, but his name may be better understood if one realizes how plains
Indians respected and honored the bull buffalo. Whites considered this animal to be exceptionally stupid. Col. Dodge
states without equivocation that the buffalo is the dullest creature of which he has any knowledge. A herd of buffalo
would graze complacently while every member was shot down. He himself shot two cows and thirteen calves while
the survivors grazed and watched. He and others in his party had to shout and wave their hats to drive the herd away
so the dead animals could be butchered.
Indians, however, regarded buffalo as the wisest and most powerful of creatures, nearest to the omnipresent Spirit.
Furthermore if one says in English that somebody is sitting it means he is seated, balanced on the haunches; but the
Sioux expression has an additional sense, not equivalent to but approximating the English words situate and locate
and reside.
Thus from an Indian point of view, the name Sitting Bull signified a wise and powerful being who had taken up residence among them.
As a boy, he was called Slow, Hunkesni, because of his deliberate manner, and it has been alleged that his parents 
thought him ordinary, perhaps even a bit slow in the head. Most biographies state that he was known also as Jumping
Badger; but Stanley Vestal, after talking to many Indians who knew his, said that none of them nor any member of Sitting Bulls family could remember his being called Jumping Badger. In any event, Slow he was called, and Slow would
suffice until he distinguished himself."
126,"The Story of Art, 16th Edition","Gombrich, E.H. ",b136_TheStoryofArtthEdition.txt,5,"In one of his letters to a young painter, Czanne had advised him to look at nature in terms of spheres, cones and
cylinders. He presumably meant that he should always keep these basic solid shapes in mind when organizing his
pictures. But Picasso and his friends decided to take this advice literally. I suppose that they reasoned somewhat like
this: We have long given up claiming that we represent things as they appear to our eyes. That was a will-o-the-wisp
which it is useless to pursue. We do not want to fix on the canvas the imaginary impression of a fleeting moment.
Let us follow Czannes example, and build up the picture of our motifs as solidly and enduringly as we can. Why not
be consistent and accept the fact that our real aim is rather to construct something, rather than to copy something?
If we think of an object, let us say a violin, it does not appear before the eye of our mind the way it would appear
before our bodily eyes. We can, and in fact do, think of its various aspects at the same time. Some of them stand out
so clearly that we feel we can touch them and handle them; others are somehow blurred. And this strange medley of
images represents more of the real violin than any single snapshot or meticulous painting could ever contain. This,
I suppose, was the reasoning which led to such paintings as Picassos still life of a violin, figure 374. In some respects,
it represents a return to what we have called Egyptian principles, in which an object was drawn from the angle from
which its characteristic form came out most clearly."

common enough at the time. And the fact that the cod could talk was not especially
surprising. But what was astonishing was that it spoke an unknown language. It spoke
Basque.
This Basque folktale shows not only the Basque attachment to their orphan language,
indecipherable to the rest of the world, but also their tie to the Atlantic cod, Gadus
morhua, a fish that has never been found in Basque or even Spanish waters.
The Basques are enigmatic. They have lived in what is now the northwest corner of
Spain and a nick of the French southwest for longer than history records, and not only is
the origin of their language unknown, but also the origin of the people themselves
remains a mystery also. According to one theory, these rosy-cheeked, dark-haired,
long-nosed people were the original Iberians, driven by invaders to this mountainous
corner between the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Sierra, and the Bay of Biscay. Or they
may be indigenous to this area.
They graze sheep on impossibly steep, green slopes of mountains that are thrilling in
their rare, rugged beauty. They sing their own songs and write their own literature in
their own language, Euskera. Possibly Europe’s oldest living language, Euskera is one
of only four European languages—along with Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian—not in
the Indo-European family."

victory for the colonists and the founding of a new nation, the United States of America. Only eighty-five years later,
in 1861, the first shots were fired in a different wara war between the states that became known as the Civil War. It
was a war fought between the Confederate States of America and the states that remained in the Unioneach side
representing a distinct economy, labor system, and philosophy of government. The southern states that formed the
Confederacy had agricultural economies that depended on a slave workforce and believed that any rights not granted
to the federal government by the United States Constitution belonged to the states. The northern states were undergoing rapid industrialization, which depended on wage labor, and while northerners disagreed among themselves
about slavery, most believed it represented a direct challenge to their own rights and freedoms. Most also believed 
that a strong federal government, with the ability to legislate behavior in areas not specifically set forth in the Constitution, was key to the growth and strength of the American republic. It was inevitable that these two very distinct
societies would clash. For the Confederates, nicknamed Rebels, the Civil War was a new war of Independence. For
the Unionists, nicknamed Yankees, it was a war to preserve the Union that had been so dearly won in the American
Revolution.
In the eyes of the four and an half million African Americans, enslaved and free, it was a war about slavery; and they
wanted to be part of the fight. But many northern whites did not want blacks to serve in the northern military. They
called it a white mans war and said that slavery was not the main point of the conflict. At first, northern generals
actually sent escaped slaves back to their southern masters. Eventually, the Union did accept blacks into its army and
navy.
A total of 178,895 black men served in 120 infantry regiments, twelve heavy artillery regiments, ten light artillery batteries, and seven cavalry regiments. Black soldiers constituted twelve percent of the Norths fighting forces, and they
suffered a disproportionate number of casualties."

at least thirty-five leagues distant from land; but, before I could reach the quarter-deck, the ship gave a great
stroke upon the ground, and the sea broke over her. Just after this I could perceive the land, rocky, rugged and
uneven, about two cables’ length from us…the masts soon went overboard, carrying some men with them…
notwithstanding a most terrible sea, one of the [lifeboats] was launched, and eight of the best men jumped
into her; but she had scarcely got to the ship’s stern when she was hurled to the bottom, and every soul in her

resignation for Providence to assist us.
—From an account of the wreck of HMS Litchfield off the coast of North Africa, 1758
The Litchfield came to grief because no one aboard knew where they were. As the narrator tells us, by his own reckoning and that of everyone else they were supposed to be thirty-five leagues, about a hundred miles, from land. The
word “reckoning” was short for “dead reckoning”—the system used by ships at sea to keep track of their position,
meaning their longitude and latitude. It was an intricate system, a craft, and like every other craft involved the mastery of certain tools, in this case such instruments as compass, hourglass, and quadrant. It was an art as well.
Latitude, the north-south position, had always been the navigator’s faithful guide. Even in ancient times, a Greek or
Roman sailor could tell how far north of the equator he was by observing the North Star’s height above the horizon,
or the sun’s at noon. This could be done without instruments, trusting in experience and the naked eye, although it is
believed that an ancestor of the quadrant called the astrolabe—”star-measurer”—was known to the ancients, and used
by them to measure the angular height of the sun or a star above the horizon.
Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans tended to sail along the coasts and were rarely out of sight of land. As later navigators left the safety of the Mediterranean to plunge into the vast Atlantic—far from shore, and from the shorebirds that
led them to it—they still had the sun and the North Star. And these enabled them to follow imagined parallel lines
of latitude that circle the globe. Following a line of latitude—”sailing the parallel”—kept a ship on a steady east-west
course. Christopher Columbus, who sailed the parallel in 1492, held his ships on such a safe course, west and west
again, straight on toward Asia."
130,The Illustrated Book of Great Composers,"Thompson, Wendy",b140_TheIllustratedBook.txt,5,"Music as a Language Music as a language is the most mysterious of all art forms. People who can easily come to
terms with a work of literature or a painting are still often baffled by the process by which a piece of music  appearing in material form as notation  must then be translated back into sound through the medium of a third party  the
performer. Unlike a painting, a musical composition cannot be owned (except by its creator); and although a score
may be published, like a book, it may remain incomprehensible to the general public until it is performed. Although a
piece may be played thousands of times each repetition is entirely individual, and interpretations by different players
may vary widely.
Origins of musical notation The earliest musical compositions were circumscribed by the range of the human voice.
People from all cultures have always sung, or used primitive instruments to make sounds. Notation, or the writing
down of music, developed to enable performers to remember what they had improvised, to preserve what they had

created, and to facilitate interaction between more than one performer. Musical notation, like language, has ancient
origins, dating back to the Middle East in the third millennium BC. The ancient Greeks appear to have been the first to
try to represent variations of musical pitch through the medium of the alphabet, and successive civilizations all over
the world attempted to formulate similar systems of recognizable musical notation.
Neumatic notation The earliest surviving Western European notational system was called neumatic notationa
system of symbols which attempted to portray the rise and fall of a melodic line. These date back to the 9th century AD, and were associated with the performance of sacred music particularly plainsongin monastic institutions.
Several early manuscript sources contain sacred texts with accompanying notation, although there was no standard
system. The first appearance of staff notation, in which pitch was indicated by noteheads on or between lines with
a symbol called a clef at the beginning to fix the pitch of one note, was in the 9th century French treatise Musica
enchiriadis. At the same time music for instruments (particularly organ and lute) was beginning to be written down in
diagrammatic form known as tablature, which indicated the positions of the players fingers."

Scientists know that maize, called corn in the United States, was created more than 6,000 years ago. Although
exactly how this well-know plant was invented is still a mystery, they do know where it was inventedin the narrow waist of southern Mexico. This jumble of mountains, beaches, wet tropical forests, and dry plains is the most
ecologically diverse part of Mesoamerica. Today it is the home of more than a dozen different Indian groups, but the
human history of these hills and valleys stretches far into the past.
From Hunting to Gathering to Farming
About 11,500 years ago a group of Paleoindians was living in caves in what is now the Mexican state of Puebla. These
people were hunters, but they did not bring down mastodons and mammoths. Those huge species were already
extinct. Now and then they even feasted on giant turtles (which were probably a lot easier to catch than the fastmoving deer and rabbits.)
Over the next 2,000 years, though, game animals grew scarce. Maybe the people of the area had been too successful
at hunting. Maybe, as the climate grew slowly hotter and drier, the grasslands where the animals lived shrank, and so
the animal populations shrank, as well. Perhaps the situation was a combination of these two reasons. Whatever the
explanation, hunters of Puebla and the neighboring state of Oaxaca turned to plants for more of their food.

132,Elements,Euclid,b142_Elements.txt,5,"A point is that of which there is no part.
And a line is a length without breadth.
And the extremities of a line are points.
A straight-line is whatever lies evenly with points upon itself.
And a surface is that which has length and breadth alone.
And the extremities of a surface are lines.
A plane surface is whatever lies evenly with straight-lines upon itself.
And a plane angle is the inclination of the lines, when two lines in a plane meet one another, and are not laid
down straight-on with respect to one another.
And when the lines containing the angle are straight then the angle is called rectilinear.
And when a straight-line stood upon (another) straight-line makes adjacent angles (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle, and the former straight-line is called perpendicular to that upon
which it stands.
An obtuse angle is greater than a right-angle.
And an acute angle is less than a right-angle.
A boundary is that which is the extremity of something.
A figure is that which is contained by some boundary or boundaries.
A circle is a plane figure contained by a single line [which is called a circumference], (such that) all of the
straight-lines radiating towards [the circumference] from a single point lying inside the figure are equal to one
another.
And the point is called the center of the circle.
And a diameter of the circle is any straight-line, being drawn through the center, which is brought to an end in
each direction by the circumference of the circle. And any such (straight-line) cuts the circle in half.
And a semi-circle is the figure contained by the diameter and the circumference it cuts off. And the center of the
semi-circle is the same (point) as the (center of) the circle.
Rectilinear figures are those figures contained by straight-lines: trilateral figures being contained by three
straight-lines, quadrilateral by four, and multilateral by more than four.
And of the trilateral figures: an equilateral triangle is that having three equal sides, an isosceles (triangle) that
having only two equal sides, and a scalene (triangle) that having three unequal sides.
And further of the trilateral figures: a right-angled triangle is that having a right-angle, an obtuse-angled (triangle) that having an obtuse angle, and an acute-angled (triangle) that having three acute angles.
And of the quadrilateral figures: a square is that which is right-angled and equilateral, a rectangle that which is
right-angled but not equilateral, a rhombus that which is equilateral but not right-angled, and a rhomboid that
having opposite sides and angles equal to one another which is neither right-angled nor equilateral. And let
quadrilateral figures besides these be called trapezia.
Parallel lines are straight-lines which, being in the same plane, and being produced to infinity in each direction,
meet with one another in neither (of these directions).
Postulates
Let it have been postulated to draw a straight-line from any point to any point.
And to produce a finite straight-line continuously in a straight-line.
And to draw a circle with any center and radius.
And that all right-angles are equal to one another.
And that if a straight-line falling across two (other) straight-lines makes internal angles on the same side (of

Common Notions
Things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.

Proposition 1
To construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight-line.
Let AB be the given finite straight-line.
So it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight-line AB.
Let the circle BCD with center A and radius AB have been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle ACE with center
B and radius BA have been drawn [Post. 3]. And let the straight-lines CA and CB have been joined from the point C,
where the circles cut one another, to the points A and B (respectively) [Post. 1].
And since the point A is the center of the circle CDB, AC is equal to AB [Def. 1.15]. Again, since the point B is the
center of the circle CAE, BC is equal to BA [Def. 1.15]. But CA was also shown to be equal to AB. Thus, CA and CB are
each equal to AB. But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N.1]. Thus, CA is also equal to
CB. Thus, the three (straight-lines) CA, AB, and BC are equal to one another.
Thus, the triangle ABC is equilateral, and has been constructed on the given finite straight-line AB. (Which is) the very
thing it was required to do."
133,“Classifying the Stars.”,"Cannon, Annie J",b143_ClassifyingtheStars.txt,5,"Sunlight and starlight are composed of waves of various lengths, which the eye, even aided by a telescope, is unable
to separate. We must use more than a telescope. In order to sort out the component colors, the light must be dispersed by a prism, or split up by some other means. For instance, sunbeams passing through rain drops, are transformed into the myriad-tinted rainbow. The familiar rainbow spanning the sky is Natures most glorious demonstration
that light is composed of many colors.
The very beginning of our knowledge of the nature of a star dates back to 1672, when Isaac Newton gave to the world
the results of his experiments on passing sunlight through a prism. To describe the beautiful band of rainbow tints,
produced when sunlight was dispersed by his three-cornered piece of glass, he took from the Latin the word spectrum, meaning an appearance. The rainbow is the spectrum of the Sun.
In 1814, more than a century after Newton, the spectrum of the Sun was obtained in such purity that an amazing
detail was seen and studied by the German optician, Fraunhofer. He saw that the multiple spectral tings, ranging from
delicate violet to deep red, were crossed by hundreds of fine dark lines. In other words, there were narrow gaps in the
spectrum where certain shades were wholly blotted out.
We must remember that the word spectrum is applied not only to sunlight, but also to the light of any glowing substance when its rays are sorted out by a prism or a grating. "
134,“Amusement Park Physics.”,"Walker, Jearl",b144_AmusementParkPhysics.txt,5,"The rides in an amusement park not only are fun but also demonstrate principles of physics. Among them are rotational dynamics and energy conversion. I have been exploring the rides at Geauga Lake Amusement Park near Cleveland and have found that nearly every ride offers a memorable lesson.
To me the scariest rides at the park are the roller coasters. The Big Dipper is similar to many of the roller coasters that
have thrilled passengers for most of this century. The cars are pulled by chain t the top of the highest hill along the
track, Released from the chain as the front of the car begins its descent, the unpowered cars have almost no speed
and only a small acceleration. As more cars get onto the downward slope the acceleration increases. It peaks when all
the cars are headed downward. The peak value is the product of the acceleration generated by gravity and the sine of
the slope of the track. A steeper descent generates a greater acceleration, but packing the coaster with heavier passengers does not.
When the coaster reaches the bottom of the valley and starts up the next hill, there is an instant when the cars are
symmetrically distributed in the valley. The acceleration is zero. As more cars ascend the coaster begins to slow,
reaching its lowest speed just as it is symmetrically positioned at the top of the hill.
A roller coaster functions by means of transfers of energy. When the chain hauls the cars to the top of the first hill,
it does work on the cars, endowing them with gravitational potential energy, the energy of a body in a gravitational
field with respect to the distance of the body from some reference level such as the ground."
135,The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story,"Preston, Richard",b145_TheHotoneATerrifyingTrueStory.txt,5,"The headache begins, typically, on the seventh day after exposure to the agent. On the seventh day
after his New Year’s visit to Kitum cave-January 8, 1980-Monet felt a throbbing pain behind his eyeballs.
He decided to stay home from work and went to bed in his bungalow. The headache grew worse. His
eyeballs ached, and then his temples began to ache, the pain seeming to circle around inside his head. It
would not go away with aspirin, and then he got a severe backache. His housekeeper, Johnnie, was still
on her Christmas vacation, and he had recently hired a temporary housekeeper. She tried to take care of
him, but she really didn’t know what to do. Then, on the third day after his headache started, he
became nauseated, spiked a fever, and began to vomit. His vomiting grew intense and turned into dry
heaves. At the same time, he became strangely passive. His face lost all appearance of life and set itself
into an expressionless mask, with the eyeballs fixed, paralytic, and staring. The eyelids were slightly
droopy, which gave him a peculiar appearance, as if his eyes were popping out of his head and half
closed at the same time. The eyeballs themselves seemed almost frozen in their sockets, and they
turned bright red. The skin of his face turned yellowish, with a brilliant starlike red speckles. He began to
look like a zombie. His appearance frightened the temporary housekeeper. She didn’t understand the
transformation in this man. His personality changed. He became sullen, resentful, angry, and his
memory seemed to be blown away. He was not delirious. He could answer questions, although he didn’t
seem to know exactly where he was.
When Monet failed to show up for work, his colleagues began to wonder about him, and eventually they
went to his bungalow to see if he was all right. The black-and-white crow sat on the roof and watched
them as they went inside. They looked at Monet and decided that he needed to get to a hospital. Since
he was very unwell and no longer able to drive a car, one of his co-workers drove him to a private
hospital in the city of Kisumu, on the shore of Lake Victoria. The doctors at the hospital examined
Monet, and could not come up with any explanation for what had happened to his eyes or his face or his
mind. Thinking that he might have some kind of bacterial infection, they gave him injections of
antibiotics, but the antibiotics had no effect on his illness.
The doctors thought he should go to Nairobi Hospital, which is the best private hospital in East Africa.
The telephone system hardly worked, and it did not seem worth the effort to call any doctors to tell
them that he was coming. He could still walk, and he seemed able to travel by himself. He had money;
he understood he had to get to Nairobi. They put him in a taxi to the airport, and he boarded a Kenya
Airways flight.
A hot virus from the rain forest lives within a twenty-four hour plane flight from every city on earth. All
of the earth’s cities are connected by a web of airline routes. The web is a network. Once a virus hits the
net, it can shoot anywhere in a day: Paris, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, wherever planes fly. Charles
Monet and the life form inside him had entered the net.
The plane was a Fokker Friendship with propellers, a commuter aircraft that seats thirty-five people. It
started its engines and took off over Lake Victoria, blue and sparkling, dotted with the dugout canoes of
fishermen. The Friendship turned and banked eastward, climbing over green hills quilted with tea
plantations and small farms. The commuter flights that drone across Africa are often jammed with
people, and this flight was probably full. The plane climbed over belts of forest and clusters of round
huts and villages with tin roofs. The land suddenly dropped away, going down in shelves and ravines,
and changed in color from green to brown. The plane was crossing the Eastern rift valley. The
passengers looked out the windows at the place where the human species was born. They say specks of
huts clustered inside circles of thornbush, with cattle trails radiating from the huts. The propellers
moaned, and the friendship passed through cloud streets, lines of puffy rift clouds, and began to bounce
and sway. Monet became airsick.
The seats are narrow and jammed together on these commuter airplanes, and you notice everything
that is happening inside the cabin. The cabin is tightly closed, and the air recirculates. If there are any
smells in the air, you perceive them. You would not have been able to ignore the man who was getting
sick. He hunches over in his seat. There is something wrong with him, but you can’t tell exactly what is
happening.
He is holding an airsickness bag over his mouth. He coughs a deep cough and regurgitates something
into the bag. The bag swells up. Perhaps he glances around, and then you see that his lips are smeared
with something slippery and red, mixed with black specks, as if he has been chewing coffee grounds. His
eyes are the color of rubies, and his face is an expressionless mass of bruises. The red spots, which a few
days before had started out as star-like speckles, have expanded and merged into huge, spontaneous
purple shadows: his whole head is turning black-and-blue. The muscles of his face droop. The connective
tissue in his face is dissolving, and his face appears to hang from the underlying bone, as if the face is
detaching itself from the skull. He opens his mouth and gasps into the bag, and the vomiting goes on
endlessly. It will not stop, and he keeps bringing up liquid, long after his stomach should have been
empty. The airsickness bag fills up to the brim with a substance know as the vomito negro, or the black
vomit. The black vomit is not really black; it is a speckled liquid of two colors, black and red, a stew of
tarry granules mixed with fresh red arterial blood. It is hemorrhage, and it smells like a slaughterhouse.
The black vomit is loaded with virus. It is highly infective, lethally hot, a liquid that would scare the
daylights out of a military biohazard specialist. The smell of the vomito negro fills the passenger cabin.
The airsickness bag is brimming with black vomit, so Monet closes the bag and rolls up the top. The bag
is bulging and softening threatening to leak, and he hands it to a flight attendant.
When a hot virus multiplies in a host, it can saturate the body with virus particles, from the brain to the
skin. The military experts then say that the virus has undergone ""extreme amplification."" This is not
something like the common cold. By the time an extreme amplification peaks out, an eyedropper of the
victim’s blood may contain a hundred million particles. In other words, the host is possessed by a life
form that is attempting to convert the host into itself. The transformation is not entirely successful, 
however, and the end result is a great deal of liquefying flesh mixed with virus, a kind of biological
accident. Extreme amplification has occurred in Monet, and the sign of it is the black vomit.
He appears to be holding himself rigid, as if any movement would rupture something inside him. His
blood is clotting up and his bloodstream is throwing clots, and the clots are lodging everywhere. His
liver, kidneys, lungs, hands, feet, and head are becoming jammed with blood clots. In effect, he is having
a stroke through the whole body. Clots are accumulating in his intestinal muscles, cutting off the blood
supply to his intestines. The intestinal muscles are beginning to die, and the intestines are starting to go
slack. He doesn’t seem to be fully aware of pain any longer because the blood clots lodged in his brain
are cutting off blood flow. His personality is being wiped away by brain damage. This is called
depersonalization, in which the liveliness and details of character seem to vanish. He is becoming an
automaton. Tiny spots in his brain are liquefying. The higher functions of consciousness are winking out
first, leaving the deeper parts of the brain stem (the primitive rat brain, the lizard brain) still alive and
functioning. It could be said that the who of Charles Monet has already died while the what of Charles
Monet continues to live.
The vomiting attack appears to have broken some blood vessels in his nose and he gets a nosebleed. The
blood comes from both nostrils, a shining, clotless, arterial liquid that drips over his teeth and chin. This
blood keeps running, because the clotting factors have been used up. A flight attendant gives him some
paper towels, which he uses to stop up his nose, but the blood still won’t coagulate, and the towels soak
through.
When a man is ill in an airline seat next to you, you may not want to embarrass him by calling attention
to the problem. You say to yourself that this man will be all right. Maybe he doesn’t travel well in
airplanes. He is airsick, the poor man, and people do get nosebleeds in airplanes, the air is so dry and
thin. . . and you ask him, weakly, if there is anything you can do to help. He does not answer, or he
mumbles words you can’t understand, so you try to ignore it, but the flight seems to go on forever.
Perhaps the flight attendants offer to help him. But victims of this type of hot virus have changes in
behavior that can render them incapable of responding to an offer of help. They become hostile, and
don’t want to be touched. They don’t want to speak.. They answer questions with grunts or
monosyllables. They can’t seem to find words. They can tell you their name, but they can’t tell you the
day of the week or explain what has happened to them."

The reason is quite simple. Suppose you double the height (or length) of any creature, say, a gorilla. The weight will
increase 8 times (i.e., 2 cubed), but the cross section of the bones will increase only fourfold (2 squared). Or, if you increase the height of the gorilla 10 times, the weight will increase, 1,000 times (10 cubed), but the cross-sectional area
of the bones will increase only 100 times (10 squared). In general, when you increase the height by a certain factor,
the weight will increase by the cube of that factor but the cross section of the bone will increase only by the square
of that factor. "
137,The Race to Save Lord God Bird,"Hoose, Phillip",b147_TheRacetoSaveLordGodBird.txt,5,"The first edition of The Race to Save the Lord God Bird was published on August 
11, 2004, a full nine months before a gathering of prestigious scientists, con- 
servationists, and officials publicly announced that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker 
had been rediscovered in Arkansas. I was not part of the search team, and was 
informed about the claimed sightings only a few weeks before headlines ap- 
peared everywhere. 
It was a Nature Conservancy colleague who called me on a Sunday afternoon. 
“Are you sitting down?” he said. When he told me that experts, some from the 
Cornell Lab of Ornithology, had recently sighted at least one Ivory-billed Woodpecker in an Arkansas swamp forest, I remember feeling first stunned and 
then skeptical. It just didn’t seem possible. How could even a small population 
of a bird not seen for sure in a half century have survived for so long? And if the 
bird they were reporting was the last individual, how old could it be? But soon 
tendrils of hope took root. What if it’s true? I kept wondering. How cool would 
that be! 
My life as an author changed the instant the claim became public. There was 
overnight interest in my book. Sales heated up, and I was in sudden demand as 
a speaker. I flew down to Arkansas twice to give presentations and to join the 
search for signs of Ivory-bills. It was a gold-rush atmosphere of anticipation and 
excitement. Searchers paddled out every morning and came back at sundown to swap stories of finds, signs, glimpses, and near misses over dinner. I spent 
most of the next year on the road, narrating a PowerPoint presentation of the im- 
ages in Race to Save to ever larger audiences. I visited twenty-six states and gave 
about eighty presentations to crowds at museums, schools, auditoriums, 
homes, Nature Conservancy field offices, downtown theaters, rural nature cen- 
ters, a mansion in Kentucky, two zoos, and the Harvard Club of New York. A few 
times I co-presented with Gene Sparling, the kayaker who first reported seeing 
an Ivory-bill in Arkansas. We drew huge crowds. I would lead off with a presen- 
tation on the history of the Ivory-bill, its decline and attempts to save it, and then 
Gene would step forward to talk about Arkansas. He often brought audiences to 
tears. As months went by, scientists began to author articles published in scientific 
journals challenging the claimed sightings in Arkansas. Their attitude was: ex- 
traordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and what they were seeing wasn’t 
conclusive. As doubt and acrimony crept into the public discussion, my book 
appearances also took on a sharper edge. In the early, honeymoon phase, I 
would finish showing my slides, take a bow, and ask for questions. Audience 
members—shyly at first, and then with more nerve as conversation developed— 
raised their hands to discuss all sorts of things, from specifics of the Arkansas 
claims to the tragedy of extinction and what could be done about it. Those 
rooms were charged with hope and optimism."
138,The Story of Science: Newton at the Center,"Hakim, Joy",b148_TheStoryofScienceNewtonattheCenter.txt,5,"Probability, a branch of mathematics, began with gambling. Pierre de Fermat (of the famous Last Theorem), Blaise
Pascal, and the Bernoullis wanted to know the mathematical odds of winning at the card table. Probability didnt tell
them for certain that they would or wouldnt draw an ace; it just told them how likely it was. A deck of 52 cards has 4
aces, so the odds of the first drawn card being an ace are 4 in 52 (or 1in 13).
If 20 cards have been played and not an ace among them, those odds improve to 4 in 32 (1in 8). Always keep in mind
that probability is about the likelihood of outcomes, not the certainty. If there are only 4 cards left in the deck, and no
aces have been played, you can predict with certainty that the next card will be an acebut youre not using probability; youre using fact. Probability is central to the physics that deals with the complex world inside atoms. We cant
determine the action of an individual particle, but with a large number of atoms, predictions based on probability
become very accurate."
139,Circumference: Eratosthenes and the Ancient Quest to Measure the Globe,"Nicastro, Nicholas",b149_Circumference.txt,5,"The astrolabe (in Greek, star reckoner) is a manual computing and observation device with myriad uses in astronomy, time keeping, surveying, navigation, and astrology. The principles behind the most common variety, the
planispheric astrolabe, were first laid down in antiquity by the Greeks, who pioneered the notion of projecting threedimensional images on flat surfaces. The device reached a high degree of refinement in the medieval Islamic world,
where it was invaluable for determining prayer times and the direction of Mecca from anywhere in the Muslim world.
The astrolabe was introduced to Europe by the eleventh century, where is saw wide use until the Renaissance.
The fundamental innovation underlying the astrolabe was the projection of an image of the sky (usually the northern
hemisphere, centered on Polaris) on a plane corresponding to the earths equator. This image, which was typically
etched on a brass plate, was inserted into a round frame (the mater) whose circumference was marked in degrees
or hours. Over the plate was fitted a lattice-work disk, the rete, with pointers to indicate the positions of major stars.
A metal hand, similar to those on a clock, was hinged with the rete at the center of the instrument, as was a sighting
vane (the alidade) for determining the angular height of the stars or other features, such as mountaintops. The entire
device was usually not more than six to eight inches in diameter and half an inch thick.
One common use of the astrolabe was to determine the time of day, even after dark.
Other uses included determination of sunrise, and sunset times for any date past or future, predicting eclipses, finding
important stars or constellations, and measuring the height of earthbound objects and the circumference of the earth.
For this and other reasons, the astrolabe has been called the worlds first personal computer."
140,The Canterbury Tales,"Chaucer, Geoffrey",b151_TheCanterburyTales.txt,6,"When in April the sweet showers fall
That pierce Marchs drought to the root and all
And bathed every vein in liquor that has power
To generate therein and sire the flower;
When Zephyr also has with his sweet breath,
Filled again, in every holt and heath,
The tender shoots and leaves, and the young sun
His half-course in the sign of the Ram has run,
And many little birds make melody
That sleep through all the night with open eye
(So Nature pricks them on to ramp and rage)
Then folk do long to go on pilgrimage,
And palmers to go seeking out strange strands,
To distant shrines well known in distant lands.
And specially from every shires end
Of England they to Canterbury went,
The holy blessed martyr there to seek
Who helped them when they lay so ill and weak
It happened that, in that season, on a day
In Southwark, at the Tabard, as I lay
Ready to go on pilgrimage and start
To Canterbury, full devout at heart,
There came at nightfall to that hostelry
Some nine and twenty in a company
Of sundry persons who had chanced to fall
In fellowship, and pilgrims were they all
That toward Canterbury town would ride.
The rooms and stables spacious were and wide,
And well we there were eased, and of the best.
And briefly, when the sun had gone to rest,
So had I spoken with them, every one,
That I was of their fellowship anon,
And made agreement that wed early rise
To take the road, as I will to you apprise.
But none the less, whilst I have time and space,
Before yet further in this tale I pace,
It seems to me in accord with reason
To describe to you the state of every one
Of each of them, as it appeared to me,
And who they were, and what was their degree,
And even what clothes they were dressed in;
And with a knight thus will I first begin."
141,Don Quixote,"de Cervantes, Miguel",b152_DonQuixote.txt,6,"In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those
gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of
rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet 
breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had
in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to
saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a
hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although
from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to
our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hairs breadth from the truth in the telling of it.
You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year
round) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected
the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and
infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as many of
them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silvas composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading
he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like the reason of the unreason with which my
reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty; or again, the high heavens, that
of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves. Over
conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and worm
the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had he come to life again for
that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed
to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with
seams and scars. He commended, however, the authors way of ending his book with the promise of that interminable
adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which
no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing
thoughts prevented him.
Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which
had been the better knight, Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village barber, however, used
to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him
it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was
no finikin knight, nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him. In short,
he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark,
poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy
grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings,
loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention
and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy
Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one
back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus
the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which
is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the
seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that
traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.
In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and
that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for the service of his
country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in
quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knightserrant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap
eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond
at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put
his scheme into execution.
The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been for ages
lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but
he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked
like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his sword and gave it a
couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had
knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars
of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments with it,
he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.
He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of
Gonela, that tantum pellis et ossa fuit, surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid.
Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse 
belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and
he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was;
for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a
distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to follow. And so, after having
composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy, he
decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack
before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.
Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight days
more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself Don Quixote, whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada,
and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called
himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of
La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his
surname from it.
So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed,
he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a
knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, If,
for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant,
and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will
it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my
sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,
vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure? Oh, how our
good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady!
There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one
time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was Aldonza
Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name
which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady,
he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Tobososhe being of El Tobosoa name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,
and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him."
142,Pride and Prejudice,"Austen, Jane",b153_PrideandPrejudice.txt,6,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so
well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of someone or other
of their daughters.
My dear Mr. Bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
But it is, returned she; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
Do not you want to know who has taken it? cried his wife impatiently.
You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
This was invitation enough.
Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the
north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his
servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.
What is his name?
Bingley.
Is he married or single?
Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our
girls!
How so? how can it affect them?
My dear Mr. Bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying
one of them.
Is that his design in settling here?
Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore
you must visit him as soon as he comes.
I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still
better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.
My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary
now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.
In such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of.
But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
It is more than I engage for, I assure you.
But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady
Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no new-comers. Indeed you
must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.
You are over-scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you
to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls: though I must throw in a good
word for my little Lizzy.
I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome
as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.
They have none of them much to recommend them, replied he; they are all silly and ignorant, like other girls; but
Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.
Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way! You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.
You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention
them with consideration these twenty years at least.
Ah! you do not know what I suffer.
But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.
It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.
Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of threeand-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to
develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting
and news. "
143,“The Cask of Amontillado.”,"Poe, Edgar Allan",b154_TheCaskofAmontillado.txt,6,"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge.
You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I
would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has
done the wrong.
It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued,
as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation.
He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He
prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In
painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In
this respect I did not differ from him materially; --I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.
It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He
accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting
parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I
thought I should never have done wringing his hand.
I said to him --My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.
How? said he. Amontillado, A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!
I have my doubts, I replied; and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the
matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.
Amontillado!
I have my doubts.
Amontillado!
And I must satisfy them.
Amontillado!
As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If any one has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me --
Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.
And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.
Come, let us go. "
144,Jane Eyre,"Brontë, Charlotte",b155_JaneEyre.txt,6,"There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had
been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the
morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company,
dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so
sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise
was now out of the question.

I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,
with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings
of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical
inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round
their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the
fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither
quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had
dispensed from joining the group; saying, ""She regretted to be
under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until
she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation,
that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable
and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner
-- something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were -- she
really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented,
happy, little children.""

""What does Bessie say I have done?"" I asked.

""Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is
something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that
manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly,
remain silent.""

A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking
care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into
the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like
a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I
was shrined in double retirement.

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the
left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating
me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over
the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.
Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of
wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away
wildly before a long and lamentable blast.

I returned to my book -- Bewick's History of British Birds: the
letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and
yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I
could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of
the haunts of sea-fowl; of ""the solitary rocks and promontories""
by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles
from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape -

""Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.""

Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of
Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland,
with ""the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions
of dreary space, -- that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm
fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed
in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre
the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."" Of these death-white realms
I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended
notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely
impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected
themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the
broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly
moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.

I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,
with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low
horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,
attesting the hour of eventide.

The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine
phantoms.

The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
quickly: it was an object of terror.

So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a
distant crowd surrounding a gallows.

Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:
as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter
evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having
brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us
to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and
crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages
of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads;
or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela,
and Henry, Earl of Moreland.

With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my
way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.
The breakfast-room door opened.

""Boh! Madam Mope!"" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused:
he found the room apparently empty.

""Where the dickens is she!"" he continued. ""Lizzy! Georgy!
(calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run
out into the rain -- bad animal!""

""It is well I drew the curtain,"" thought I; and I wished fervently
he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have
found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception;
but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once -

""She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.""

And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being
dragged forth by the said Jack.

""What do you want?"" I asked, with awkward diffidence.

""Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'"" was the answer. ""I want
you to come here;"" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated
by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.

John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older
than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a
dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage,
heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually
at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared
eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but
his mama had taken him home for a month or two, ""on account of his
delicate health."" Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would
do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from
home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and
inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's sallowness
was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.

John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and
an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three
times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually:
every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones
shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered
by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against
either his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like to
offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs.
Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike
or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very
presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.

Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent
some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he
could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike,
and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly
appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he
read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking,
he struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my
equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.

""That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,"" said
he, ""and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for
the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!""

Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying
to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly
follow the insult.

""What were you doing behind the curtain?"" he asked.

""I was reading.""

""Show the book.""

I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

""You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama
says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to
beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and
eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.
Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they ARE mine;
all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and
stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.""

I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when
I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I
instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,
however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my
head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was
sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.

""Wicked and cruel boy!"" I said. ""You are like a murderer -- you
are like a slave-driver -- you are like the Roman emperors!""

I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion
of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence,
which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.

""What! what!"" he cried. ""Did she say that to me? Did you hear
her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first -- ""

He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder:
he had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant,
a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle
down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these
sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him
in frantic sort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands,
but he called me ""Rat! Rat!"" and bellowed out aloud. Aid was
near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone
upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie
and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words -

""Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!""

""Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!""

Then Mrs. Reed subjoined -

""Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."" Four hands
were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

CHAPTER II

I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance
which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot
were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle
beside myself; or rather OUT of myself, as the French would say:
I was conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me
liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I
felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.

""Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.""

""For shame! for shame!"" cried the lady's-maid. ""What shocking
conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's
son! Your young master.""

""Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?""

""No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.""

They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs.
Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from
it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.

""If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,"" said Bessie. ""Miss
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.""

Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.
This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred,
took a little of the excitement out of me.

""Don't take them off,"" I cried; ""I will not stir.""

In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.

""Mind you don't,"" said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that
I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and
Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully
on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.

""She never did so before,"" at last said Bessie, turning to the
Abigail.

""But it was always in her,"" was the reply. ""I've told Missis often
my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She's an
underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much
cover.""

Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said -- ""You
ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs.
Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have
to go to the poorhouse.""

I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my
very first recollections of existence included hints of the same
kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song
in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.
Miss Abbot joined in -

""And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses
Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought
up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will
have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make
yourself agreeable to them.""

""What we tell you is for your good,"" added Bessie, in no harsh
voice, ""you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps,
you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude,
Missis will send you away, I am sure.""

""Besides,"" said Miss Abbot, ""God will punish her: He might strike
her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?
Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for
anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself;
for if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come
down the chimney and fetch you away.""

They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.

The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might
say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at
Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the
accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and
stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive
pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood
out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with
their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons
and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the
foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were
a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the
toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the
piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy
Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample
cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a
footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.

This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,
because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it
was known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here
on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's
quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it
to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe,
where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature
of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret
of the red-room -- the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of
its grandeur.

Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed
his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration
had guarded it from frequent intrusion.

My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me
riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed
rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe,
with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels;
to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between
them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not
quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move,
I got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure.
Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated
glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked
colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and
the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where
all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought
it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's
evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells
in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I
returned to my stool.

Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her
hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of
the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I
had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed
to the dismal present.

All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned
up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why
was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for
ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to
try to win any one's favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish,
was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid
spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged.
Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight
to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.
John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the
necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs
at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke
the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
his mother ""old girl,"" too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently
tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still ""her own darling.""
I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was
termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to
noon, and from noon to night.

My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received:
no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I
had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was
loaded with general opprobrium.

""Unjust! -- unjust!"" said my reason, forced by the agonising
stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve,
equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve
escape from insupportable oppression -- as running away, or, if that
could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting
myself die.

What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How
all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!
Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle
fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inward question -- WHY I
thus suffered; now, at the distance of -- I will not say how many
years, I see it clearly.

I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had
nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen
vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love
them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that
could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing,
opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a
useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to
their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation
at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that
had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
romping child -- though equally dependent and friendless -- Mrs. Reed
would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would
have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling;
the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat
of the nursery.

Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock,
and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard
the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and
the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees
cold as a stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of
humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers
of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be
so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself
to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or
was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting
bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried;
and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was
my own uncle -- my mother's brother -- that he had taken me when
a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he
had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain
me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she
had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her
nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper
not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband's
death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself
bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to
a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien
permanently intruded on her own family group."
145,The Scarlet Letter,"Hawthorne, Nathaniel",b156_TheScarletLetter.txt,6,"The road, after the two wayfarers had crossed from the Peninsula to the mainland, was no other than a foot-path.
It straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest. This hemmed it in so narrowly, and stood so black and
dense on either side, and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that, to Hesters mind, it imaged not
amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering. The day was chill and sombre. Overhead was
a gray expanse of cloud, slightly stirred, however, by a breeze; so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and
then be seen at its solitary play along the path. This flitting cheerfulness was always at the further extremity of some
long vista through the forest. The sportive sunlight--feebly sportive, at best, in the predominant pensiveness of the
day and scene--withdrew itself as they came nigh, and left the spots where it had danced the drearier, because they
had hoped to find them bright.
Mother, said little Pearl, the sunshine does not love you. It runs away and hides itself, because it is afraid of something on your bosom. Now, see! There it is, playing a good way off. Stand you here, and let me run and catch it. I am
but a child. It will not flee from me--for I wear nothing on my bosom yet!
Nor ever will, my child, I hope, said Hester.
And why not, mother? asked Pearl, stopping short, just at the beginning of her race. Will not it come of its own accord when I am a woman grown?
Run away, child, answered her mother, and catch the sunshine. It will soon be gone 
Pearl set forth at a great pace, and as Hester smiled to perceive, did actually catch the sunshine, and stood laughing
in the midst of it, all brightened by its splendor, and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion. The light
lingered about the lonely child, as if glad of such a playmate, until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step
into the magic circle too.
It will go now, said Pearl, shaking her head.
See! answered Hester, smiling; now I can stretch out my hand and grasp some of it.
As she attempted to do so, the sunshine vanished; or, to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on Pearls
features, her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself, and would give it forth again, with
a gleam about her path, as they should plunge into some gloomier shade. There was no other attribute that so much
impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in Pearls nature, as this never failing vivacity of spirits:
she had not the disease of sadness, which almost all children, in these latter days, inherit, with the scrofula, from the
troubles of their ancestors. Perhaps this, too, was a disease, and but the reflex of the wild energy with which Hester
had fought against her sorrows before Pearls birth. It was certainly a doubtful charm, imparting a hard, metallic lustre
to the childs character. She wanted--what some people want throughout life--a grief that should deeply touch her,
and thus humanize and make her capable of sympathy. But there was time enough yet for little Pearl.
Come, my child! said Hester, looking about her from the spot where Pearl had stood still in the sunshine--we will sit
down a little way within the wood, and rest ourselves."
146,Crime and Punishment,"Dostoevsky, Fyodor",b157_CrimeandPunishment.txt,6,"On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and
walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.
He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl
and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.
This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated
from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but
the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be
stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats
and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lieno, rather than that, he would creep down
the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.
This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.
I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles, he thought, with an odd smile. Hm... yes, all is
in a mans hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, thats an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men
are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. Its
because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. Ive learned to chatter this last
month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable
of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. Its simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a
plaything.
The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all
about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summerall
worked painfully upon the young mans already overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses,
which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it
was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed
for a moment in the young mans refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in
height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring
to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just
confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was
very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food.
He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the
street in such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance
of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so
various were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was such
accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young mans heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he
minded his rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown
reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he
drove past: Hey there, German hatter bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at himthe young man stopped
suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from Zimmermans, but completely worn out,
rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him. "
147,“A White Heron.”,"Jewett, Sarah Orne",b158_AWhiteHeron.txt,6,"Half a mile from home, at the farther edge of the woods, where the land was highest, a great pine-tree stood, the
last of its generation. Whether it was left for a boundary mark, or for what reason, no one could say; the woodchoppers who had felled its mates were dead and gone long ago, and a whole forest of sturdy trees, pines and oaks and
maples, had grown again. But the stately head of this old pine towered above them all and made a landmark for sea
and shore miles and miles away. Sylvia knew it well. She had always believed that whoever climbed to the top of it
could see the ocean; and the little girl had often laid her hand on the great rough trunk and looked up wistfully at
those dark boughs that the wind always stirred, no matter how hot and still the air might be below. Now she thought
of the tree with a new excitement, for why, if one climbed it at break of day, could not one see all the world, and easily
discover from whence the white heron flew, and mark the place, and find the hidden nest? 
What a spirit of adventure, what wild ambition! What fancied triumph and delight and glory for the later morning
when she could make known the secret! It was almost too real and too great for the childish heart to bear.
All night the door of the little house stood open and the whippoorwills came and sang upon the very step. The young
sportsman and his old hostess were sound asleep, but Sylvias great design kept her broad awake and watching.
She forgot to think of sleep. The short summer night seemed as long as the winter darkness, and at last when the
whippoorwills ceased, and she was afraid the morning would after all come too soon, she stole out of the house and
followed the pasture path through the woods, hastening toward the open ground beyond, listening with a sense of
comfort and companionship to the drowsy twitter of a half-awakened bird, whose perch she had jarred in passing.
Alas, if the great wave of human interest which flooded for the first time this dull little life should sweep away the
satisfactions of an existence heart to heart with nature and the dumb life of the forest!
There was the huge tree asleep yet in the paling moonlight, and small and silly Sylvia began with utmost bravery to
mount to the top of it, with tingling, eager blood coursing the channels of her whole frame, with her bare feet and
fingers, that pinched and held like birds claws to the monstrous ladder reaching up, up, almost to the sky itself. First
she must mount the white oak tree that grew alongside, where she was almost lost among the dark branches and the
green leaves heavy and wet with dew; a bird fluttered off its nest, and a red squirrel ran to and fro and scolded pettishly at the harmless housebreaker. Sylvia felt her way easily. She had often climbed there, and knew that higher still
one of the oaks upper branches chafed against the pine trunk, just where its lower boughs were set close together.
There, when she made the dangerous pass from one tree to the other, the great enterprise would really begin.
She crept out along the swaying oak limb at last, and took the daring step across into the old pine-tree. The way was
harder than she thought; she must reach far and hold fast, the sharp dry twigs caught and held her and scratched her
like angry talons, the pitch made her thin little fingers clumsy and stiff as she went round and round the trees great
stem, higher and higher upward. The sparrows and robins in the woods below were beginning to wake and twitter
to the dawn, yet it seemed much lighter there aloft in the pine-tree, and the child knew she must hurry if her project
were to be of any use.
The tree seemed to lengthen itself out as she went up, and to reach farther and farther upward. It was like a great
main-mast to the voyaging earth; it must truly have been amazed that morning through all its ponderous frame as it
felt this determined spark of human spirit wending its way from higher branch to branch. Who knows how steadily
the least twigs held themselves to advantage this light, weak creature on her way! The old pine must have loved his
new dependent. More than all the hawks, and bats, and moths, and even the sweet voiced thrushes, was the brave,
beating heart of the solitary gray-eyed child. And the tree stood still and frowned away the winds that June morning
while the dawn grew bright in the east.
Sylvias face was like a pale star, if one had seen it from the ground, when the last thorny bough was past, and she
stood trembling and tired but wholly triumphant, high in the tree-top. Yes, there was the sea with the dawning sun
making a golden dazzle over it, and toward that glorious east flew two hawks with slow-moving pinions. How low
they looked in the air from that height when one had only seen them before far up, and dark against the blue sky.
Their gray feathers were as soft as moths; they seemed only a little way from the tree, and Sylvia felt as if she too
could go flying away among the clouds. Westward, the woodlands and farms reached miles and miles into the distance; here and there were church steeples, and white villages, truly it was a vast and awesome world. "
148,"Billy Budd, Sailor","Melville, Herman",b159_BillyBuddSailor.txt,6,"At sea in the old time, the execution by halter of a military sailor was generally from the fore-yard. In the present
instance, for special reasons the main-yard was assigned. Under an arm of that lee-yard the prisoner was presently
brought up, the Chaplain attending him. It was noted at the time and remarked upon afterwards, that in this final
scene the good man evinced little or nothing of the perfunctory. Brief speech indeed he had with the condemned
one, but the genuine Gospel was less on his tongue than in his aspect and manner towards him. The final preparations personal to the latter being speedily brought to an end by two boatswains mates, the consummation impended.
Billy stood facing aft. At the penultimate moment, his words, his only ones, words wholly unobstructed in the utterance were these -- God bless Captain Vere! Syllables so unanticipated coming from one with the ignominious
hemp about his neck -- a conventional felons benediction directed aft towards the quarters of honor; syllables too
delivered in the clear melody of a singing-bird on the point of launching from the twig, had a phenomenal effect, not
unenhanced by the rare personal beauty of the young sailor spiritualized now thro late experiences so poignantly
profound.
Without volition as it were, as if indeed the ships populace were but the vehicles of some vocal current electric, with
one voice from alow and aloft came a resonant sympathetic echo -- God bless Captain Vere! And yet at that instant
Billy alone must have been in their hearts, even as he was in their eyes.
At the pronounced words and the spontaneous echo that voluminously rebounded them, Captain Vere, either thro
stoic self-control or a sort of momentary paralysis induced by emotional shock, stood erectly rigid as a musket in the
ship-armorers rack.
The hull deliberately recovering from the periodic roll to leeward was just regaining an even keel, when the last signal,
a preconcerted dumb one, was given. At the same moment it chanced that the vapory fleece hanging low in the East,
was shot thro with a soft glory as of the fleece of the Lamb of God seen in mystical vision, and simultaneously therewith, watched by the wedged mass of upturned faces, Billy ascended; and, ascending, took the full rose of the dawn.
In the pinioned figure, arrived at the yard-end, to the wonder of all no motion was apparent, none save that created

newspapers and two letters. And, by the way, sir, I wish you would give your attention to Seriozha. I saw him smoking
today and also the day before yesterday. When I told him how wrong it was he put his fingers in his ears, as he always
does, and began to sing loudly so as to drown my voice.
Eugene Bilovsky, an attorney of the circuit court, who had just come home from a session and was taking off his
gloves in his study, looked at the governess who was making this statement and laughed.
So Seriozha has been smoking! he said with a shrug of his shoulders. Fancy the little beggar with a cigarette in his
mouth! How old is he?
Seven years old. It seems of small consequence to you, but at his age smoking is a bad, a harmful habit; and bad
habits should be nipped in the bud.
You are absolutely right. Where does he get the tobacco?
From your table.
He does? In that case, send him to me.
When the governess had gone, Bilovsky sat down in an easy-chair before his writing-table and began to think. For
some reason he pictured to himself his Seriozha enveloped in clouds of tobacco smoke, with a huge, yard-long cigarette in his mouth, and this caricature made him smile. At the same time the earnest, anxious face of the governess
awakened in him memories of days long past and half-forgotten, when smoking at school and in the nursery aroused
in masters and parents a strange, almost incomprehensible horror. It really was horror. Children were unmercifully
flogged, and expelled from school, and their lives were blighted, although not one of the teachers nor fathers knew
exactly what constituted the harm and offence of smoking. Even very intelligent people did not hesitate to combat
the vice they did not understand. Bilovsky called to mind the principal of his school, a highly educated, good-natured
old man, who was so shocked when he caught a scholar with a cigarette that he would turn pale and immediately
summon a special session of the school board and sentence the offender to expulsion. No doubt that is one of the
laws of societythe less an evil is understood the more bitterly and harshly it is attacked.
The attorney thought of the two or three boys who had been expelled and of their subsequent lives, and could not
but reflect that punishment is, in many cases, more productive of evil than crime itself. The living organism possesses
the faculty of quickly adapting itself to every condition; if it were not so man would be conscious every moment of
the unreasonable foundations on which his reasonable actions rest and how little of justice and assurance are to be
found even in those activities which are fraught with so much responsibility and which are so appalling in their consequences, such as education, literature, the law
And thoughts such as these came floating into Bilovskys head; light, evanescent thoughts such as only enter weary,
resting brains. One knows not whence they are nor why they come; they stay but a short while and seem to spread
across the surface of the brain without ever sinking very far into its depths. For those whose minds for hours and days
together are forced to be occupied with business and to travel always along the same lines, these homelike, untrammelled musings bring a sort of comfort and a pleasant restfulness of their own.
It was nine oclock. On the floor overhead someone was pacing up and down, and still higher up, on the third storey,
four hands were playing scales on the piano. The person who was pacing the floor seemed, from his nervous strides,
to be the victim of tormenting thoughts or of the toothache; his footsteps and the monotonous scales added to the
quiet of the evening something somnolent that predisposed the mind to idle reveries.
In the nursery, two rooms away, Seriozha and his governess were talking.
Papa has come! sang the boy. Papa has coome! Pa! Pa! Pa!
Votre pre vous appelle, allez vite! cried the governess, twittering like a frightened bird.
What shall I say to him? thought Bilovsky.
But before he had time to think of anything to say his son Seriozha had already entered the study. This was a little
person whose sex could only be divined from his clotheshe was so delicate, and fair, and frail. His body was as
languid as a hot-house plant and everything about him looked wonderfully dainty and softhis movements, his curly
hair, his glance, his velvet tunic.
Good evening, papa, he said in a gentle voice, climbing on to his fathers knee and swiftly kissing his neck. Did you
send for me?
Wait a bit, wait a bit, master, answered the lawyer, putting him aside. Before you and I kiss each other we must have
a talk, a serious talk. I am angry with you, and I dont love you any more; do you understand that, young man? I dont
love you, and you are no son of mine.
Seriozha looked steadfastly at his father and then turned his regard to the table and shrugged his shoulders.
What have I done? he asked, perplexed, and blinked. I didnt go into your study once today, and I havent touched a
thing.
Miss Natalie has just been complaining to me that you have been smoking; is that so? Have you been smoking?
Yes, I smoked once. That is so.
There! So now you have told a lie into the bargain! said the lawyer, disguising his smile by a frown. Miss Natalie saw
you smoking twice. That means that you have been caught doing three naughty things: smoking, taking tobacco that
doesnt belong to you off my table, and telling a lie. Three accusations!

150,The Great Gatsby,"Fitzgerald, F. Scott. ",b161_TheGreatGatsby.txt,6,"There was music from my neighbor’s house through the
summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came
and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched
his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the
sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an
omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between
nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all
trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra
gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes
and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of
the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived
from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same
oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could
extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if
a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s
thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down
with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored 
44 The Great Gatsby
lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous
garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening horsd’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of
harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to
a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was
set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials
so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too
young to know one from another.
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and
saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and
high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach
now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are
parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair
shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams
of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of
cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive
with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings
between women who never knew each other’s names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from
the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail
music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter
is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped
out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same
breath—already there are wanderers, confident girls who
weave here and there among the stouter and more stable,

become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group
and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and color under the constantly
changing light.
Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a
cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas
platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies
his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter
as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s
understudy from the ‘Follies.’ The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house
I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there. They got into
automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were
introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that
they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they
came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for
the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket
of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of
robin’s egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer—the
honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend
his ‘little party’ that night. He had seen me several times
and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar
combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay 
46 The Great Gatsby
Gatsby in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a
little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease
among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though
here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young
Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and
prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling
something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were,
at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the
right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host
but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so
vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk
off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in
the garden where a single man could linger without looking
purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and
stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into
the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to
someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks
to the passers-by.
‘Hello!’ I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 47
unnaturally loud across the garden.
‘I thought you might be here,’ she responded absently as I
came up. ‘I remembered you lived next door to——‘
She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d
take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin
yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.
‘Hello!’ they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t win.’
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
‘You don’t know who we are,’ said one of the girls in yellow, ‘but we met you here about a month ago.’
‘You’ve dyed your hair since then,’ remarked Jordan, and
I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like
the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s
slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps
and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated
at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with
the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced
to us as Mr. Mumble.
‘Do you come to these parties often?’ inquired Jordan of
the girl beside her.
‘The last one was the one I met you at,’ answered the girl,
in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion:
‘Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?’
It was for Lucille, too.
‘I like to come,’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what I do, so
I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my
gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—
48 The Great Gatsby
inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new
evening gown in it.’
‘Did you keep it?’ asked Jordan.
‘Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too
big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with
lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.’
‘There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing
like that,’ said the other girl eagerly. ‘He doesn’t want any
trouble with ANYbody.’
‘Who doesn’t?’ I inquired.
‘Gatsby. Somebody told me——‘
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.’
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles
bent forward and listened eagerly.
‘I don’t think it’s so much THAT,’ argued Lucille skeptically; ‘it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.’
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
‘I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew
up with him in Germany,’ he assured us positively.
‘Oh, no,’ said the first girl, ‘it couldn’t be that, because he
was in the American army during the war.’ As our credulity
switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.
‘You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.’
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered.
We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were
whispers about him from those who found little that it was 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 49
necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join
her own party who were spread around a table on the other
side of the garden. There were three married couples and
Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent
innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner
or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the
function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully
on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
‘Let’s get out,’ whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. ‘This is much too polite for
me.’
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find
the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making
me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby
was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the
steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried
an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably
transported complete from some ruin overseas.
A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great
table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of 
50 The Great Gatsby
books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.
‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously.
‘About what?’
He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.’
‘The books?’
He nodded.
‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought
they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re
absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.’
Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the
bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‘Stoddard
Lectures.’
‘See!’ he cried triumphantly. ‘It’s a bona fide piece of
printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco.
It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew
when to stop too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you
want? What do you expect?’
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on
its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole
library was liable to collapse.
‘Who brought you?’ he demanded. ‘Or did you just come?
I was brought. Most people were brought.’
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.
‘I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,’ he continued. ‘Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 51
somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now,
and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’
‘Has it?’
‘A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an
hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—
—‘
‘You told us.’
We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden,
old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously,
fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving
the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated
tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung
in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’
all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter
rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage ‘twins’—who
turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than
finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the
Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the
stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table
with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave
way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls 
52 The Great Gatsby
of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes
into something significant, elemental and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and
smiled.
‘Your face is familiar,’ he said, politely. ‘Weren’t you in
the Third Division during the war?’
‘Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’
‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’
We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told
me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to
try it out in the morning.
‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along
the Sound.’
‘What time?’
‘Any time that suits you best.’
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
‘Having a gay time now?’ she inquired.
‘Much better.’ I turned again to my new acquaintance.
‘This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the
host. I live over there——’ I waved my hand at the invisible
hedge in the distance, ‘and this man Gatsby sent over his
chauffeur with an invitation.’
For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said suddenly.
‘What!’ I exclaimed. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 53
‘I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very
good host.’
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of
eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or
five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU
with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood
you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed
in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured
you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your
best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a
year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech
just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced
himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that
Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself
with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,’ he urged
me. ‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.’
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—
constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected
that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in
his middle years.
‘Who is he?’ I demanded. ‘Do you know?’
‘He’s just a man named Gatsby.’
54 The Great Gatsby
‘Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?’
‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with
a wan smile. ‘Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford
man.’
A dim background started to take shape behind him but
at her next remark it faded away.
‘However, I don’t believe it.’
‘Why not?’
‘I don’t know,’ she insisted, ‘I just don’t think he went
there.’
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I
think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my
curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana
or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial
inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
‘Anyhow he gives large parties,’ said Jordan, changing
the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‘And I
like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there
isn’t any privacy.’
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the
orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of
the garden.
‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he cried. ‘At the request of Mr.
Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s
latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie
Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 55
a big sensation.’ He smiled with jovial condescension and
added ‘Some sensation!’ whereupon everybody laughed.
‘The piece is known,’ he concluded lustily, ‘as ‘Vladimir
Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.’ ‘
The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone
on the marble steps and looking from one group to another
with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it
were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped
to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he
grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When
the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting
their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial
way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s
arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby
and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
‘I beg your pardon.’
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.
‘Miss Baker?’ he inquired. ‘I beg your pardon but Mr.
Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.’
‘With me?’ she exclaimed in surprise.
‘Yes, madame.’
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed
that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports 
56 The Great Gatsby
clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if
she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean,
crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused
and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s
undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to
join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in
yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall,
red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in
song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during
the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was
weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she
filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down
her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into
contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an
inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black
rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the
notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank
into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’
explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were
now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even
Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asun-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 57
der by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious
intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent
way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at
intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry
diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward
men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were
sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
‘Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to
go home.’
‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.’
‘We’re always the first ones to leave.’
‘So are we.’
‘Well, we’re almost the last tonight,’ said one of the men
sheepishly. ‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.’
In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence
was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library
opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.
He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his
manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people
approached him to say goodbye.
Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the
porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered.
‘How long were we in there?’
58 The Great Gatsby
‘Why,—about an hour.’
‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly. ‘But
I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.’ She
yawned gracefully in my face. ‘Please come and see me….
Phone book…. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard…. My aunt….’ She was hurrying off as she talked—her
brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed
so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for
him early in the evening and to apologize for not having
known him in the garden.
‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly. ‘Don’t give it
another thought, old sport.’ The familiar expression held no
more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed
my shoulder. ‘And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’
Then the butler, behind his shoulder:
‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.’
‘All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there….
good night.’
‘Good night.’
‘Good night.’ He smiled—and suddenly there seemed
to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last
to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ‘Good night, old
sport…. Good night.’
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was
not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 59
illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel,
rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two
minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable
attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as
they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant
din from those in the rear had been audible for some time
and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck
and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the
car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
‘See!’ he explained. ‘It went in the ditch.’
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the
man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.
‘How’d it happen?’
He shrugged his shoulders.
‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said decisively.
‘But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?’
‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the
whole matter. ‘I know very little about driving—next to
nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.’
‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving
at night.’
‘But I wasn’t even trying,’ he explained indignantly, ‘I
wasn’t even trying.’
60 The Great Gatsby
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
‘Do you want to commit suicide?’
‘You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not
even TRYing!’
‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal. ‘I wasn’t
driving. There’s another man in the car.’
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in
a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coupé swung slowly
open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was
a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale
dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by
the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood
swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the
duster.
‘Wha’s matter?’ he inquired calmly. ‘Did we run outa
gas?’
‘Look!’
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he
stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though
he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
‘It came off,’ some one explained.
He nodded.
‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.’
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening
his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:
‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’

At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than
he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer
joined by any physical bond.
‘Back out,’ he suggested after a moment. ‘Put her in reverse.’
‘But the WHEEL’S off!’
He hesitated.
‘No harm in trying,’ he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I
turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced
back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s
house, making the night fine as before and surviving the
laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and
the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a
formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given
the impression that the events of three nights several weeks
apart were all that absorbed me."
151,As I Lay Dying,"Faulkner, William",b162_AsILayDying.txt,6,"Jewel and I come up from the field, following the path in single file. Although I am fifteen feet ahead of him, anyone
watching us from the cottonhouse can see Jewels frayed and broken straw hat a full head above my own.
The path runs straight as a plumb-line, worn smooth by feet and baked brick-hard by July, between the green rows of
laidby cotton, to the cottonhouse at four soft right angles and goes on across the field again, worn so by feet in fading precision.
The cottonhouse is of rough logs, from between which the chinking has long fallen. Square, with a broken roof set at
a single pitch, it leans in empty and shimmering dilapidation in the sunlight, a single broad window in two opposite
walls giving onto the approaches of the path. When we reach it I turn and follow the path which circles the house.
Jewel, fifteen feet behind me, looking straight ahead, steps in a single stride through the window. Still staring straight
ahead, his pale eyes like wood set into his wooden face, he crosses the floor in four strides with the rigid gravity of a cigar store Indian dressed in patched overalls and endued with life from the hips down, and steps in a single stride
through the opposite window and into the path again just as I come around the corner. In single file and five feet
apart and Jewel now in front, we go on up the path toward the foot of the bluff.
Tulls wagon stands beside the spring, hitched to the rail, the reins wrapped about the seat stanchion. In the wagon
bed are two chairs. Jewel stops at the spring and takes the gourd from the willow branch and drinks. I pass him and
mount the path, beginning to hear Cashs saw.
When I reach the top he has quit sawing. Standing in a litter of chips, he is fitting two of the boards together. Between the shadow spaces they are yellow as gold, like soft gold, bearing on their flanks in smooth undulations the
marks of the adze blade: a good carpenter, Cash is. He holds the two planks on the trestle, fitted along the edges in
a quarter of the finished box. He kneels and squints along the edge of them, then he lowers them and takes up the
adze. A good carpenter. Addie Bundren could not want a better one, a better box to lie in. It will give her confidence
and comfort. I go on to the house, followed by the

of the adze."
152,A Farewell to,"Hemingway, Ernest",b163_AFarewellto.txt,6,"Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going past pulled by motor-tractors. There was much traffic at night and many mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and gray motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that moved slower in the traffic. There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy branches and vines laid over the tractors. To the north we could look across a valley and see a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain on this side of the river. There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain. The vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead with the autumn. There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes; their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long 6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.

There were small gray motor-cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat. They splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went especially fast it was probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in this way nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.

At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the cholera. But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the army.

CHAPTER II
The next year there were many victories. The mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away. The town was very nice and our house was very fine. The river ran behind us and the town had been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end, because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way. People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafs and artillery up side streets and two bawdy houses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the fighting had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his motor car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long necked body and gray beard like a goats chin tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in the street, and the whole thing going well on the Carso made the fall very different from the last fall when we had been in the country. The war was changed too.

The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone. The forest had been green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain. It came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow. The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the snow going back to the latrines behind trenches.

Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of the bawdy house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily, we knew it was all over for that year. Up the river the mountains had not been taken; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken. That was all left for next year. My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his attention. The priest looked up. He saw us and smiled. My friend motioned for him to come in. The priest shook his head and went on. That night in the mess after the spaghetti course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else using a continuous lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine from the grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, clear red, tannic and lovely, poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain commenced picking on the priest.

The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray tunic. The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful benefit, in order that I might understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost.

Priest to-day with girls, the captain said looking at the priest and at me. The priest smiled and blushed and shook his head. This captain baited him often.

Not true? asked the captain. To-day I see priest with girls.

No, said the priest. The other officers were amused at the baiting.

Priest not with girls, went on the captain. Priest never with girls, he explained to me. He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not losing sight of the priest.

Priest every night five against one. Every one at the table laughed. You understand? Priest every night five against one. He made a gesture and laughed loudly. The priest accepted it as a joke.

The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war, the major said. He loves Franz Joseph. Thats where the money comes from. I am an atheist.

Did you ever read the Black Pig? asked the lieutenant. I will get you a copy. It was that which shook my faith.

It is a filthy and vile book, said the priest. You do not really like it.

It is very valuable, said the lieutenant. It tells you about those priests. You will like it, he said to me. I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle-light. Dont you read it, he said.

I will get it for you, said the lieutenant.

All thinking men are atheists, the major said. I do not believe in the Free Masons however.

I believe in the Free Masons, the lieutenant said. It is a noble organization. Some one came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling.

There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come, I said.

Certainly not, said the major. You should go on leave. You should go to Rome, Naples, Sicily

He should visit Amalfi, said the lieutenant I will write you cards to my family in Amalfi. They will love you like a son.

He should go to Palermo.

He ought to go to Capri.

I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta, said the priest.

Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi. Theres more snow there than here. He doesnt want to see peasants. Let him go to centres of culture and civilization.

He should have fine girls. I will give you the addresses of places in Naples. Beautiful young girlsaccompanied by their mothers. Ha! Ha! Ha! The captain spread his hand open, the thumb up and fingers outspread as when you make shadow pictures. There was a shadow from his hand on the wall. He spoke again in pidgin Italian. You go away like this, he pointed to the thumb, and come back like this, he touched the little finger. Every one laughed.

Look, said the captain. He spread the hand again. Again the candle-light made its shadows on the wall. He started with the upright thumb and named in their order the thumb and four fingers, soto-tenente (the thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano (next finger), maggiore (next to the little finger), and tenente-colonello (the little finger). You go away soto-tenente! You come back soto-colonello! They all laughed. The captain was having a great success with finger games. He looked at the priest and shouted, Every night priest five against one! They all laughed again.

You must go on leave at once, the major said.

I would like to go with you and show you things, the lieutenant said.

When you come back bring a phonograph.

Bring good opera disks.

Bring Caruso.

Dont bring Caruso. He bellows.

Dont you wish you could bellow like him?

He bellows. I say he bellows!

I would like you to go to Abruzzi, the priest said. The others were shouting. There is good hunting. You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear and dry. You could stay with my family. My father is a famous hunter.

Come on, said the captain. We go whorehouse before it shuts.

Good-night, I said to the priest.

Good-night, he said.

CHAPTER III
When I came back to the front we still lived in that town. There were many more guns in the country around and the spring had come. The fields were green and there were small green shoots on the vines, the trees along the road had small leaves and a breeze came from the sea. I saw the town with the hill and the old castle above it in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond, brown mountains with a little green on their slopes. In the town there were more guns, there were some new hospitals, you met British men and sometimes women, on the street, and a few more houses had been hit by shell fire. It was warm and like the spring and I walked down the alleyway of trees, warmed from the sun on the wall, and found we still lived in the same house and that it all looked the same as when I had left it. The door was open, there was a soldier sitting on a bench outside in the sun, an ambulance was waiting by the side door and inside the door, as I went in, there was the smell of marble floors and hospital. It was all as I had left it except that now it was spring. I looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting at his desk, the window open and the sunlight coming into the room. He did not see me and I did not know whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and clean up. I decided to go on upstairs.

The room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked out on the courtyard. The window was open, my bed was made up with blankets and my things hung on the wall, the gas mask in an oblong tin can, the steel helmet on the same peg. At the foot of the bed was my flat trunk, and my winter boots, the leather shiny with oil, were on the trunk. My Austrian snipers rifle with its blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut, cheek-fitted, schutzen stock, hung over the two beds. The telescope that fitted it was, I remembered, locked in the trunk. The lieutenant, Rinaldi, lay asleep on the other bed. He woke when he heard me in the room and sat up.

Ciaou! he said. What kind of time did you have?

Magnificent.

We shook hands and he put his arm around my neck and kissed me.

Oughf, I said.

Youre dirty, he said. You ought to wash. Where did you go and what did you do? Tell me everything at once.

I went everywhere. Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Villa San Giovanni, Messina, Taormina

You talk like a time-table. Did you have any beautiful adventures?

Yes.

Where?

Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli

Thats enough. Tell me really what was the best.

In Milano.

That was because it was first. Where did you meet her? In the Cova? Where did you go? How did you feel? Tell me everything at once. Did you stay all night?

Yes.

Thats nothing. Here now we have beautiful girls. New girls never been to the front before.

Wonderful.

You dont believe me? We will go now this afternoon and see. And in the town we have beautiful English girls. I am now in love with Miss Barkley. I will take you to call. I will probably marry Miss Barkley.

I have to get washed and report. Doesnt anybody work now?

Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, chilblains, jaundice, gonorrhea, self-inflicted wounds, pneumonia and hard and soft chancres. Every week some one gets wounded by rock fragments. There are a few real wounded. Next week the war starts again. Perhaps it starts again. They say so. Do you think I would do right to marry Miss Barkleyafter the war of course?

Absolutely, I said and poured the basin full of water.

To-night you will tell me everything, said Rinaldi. Now I must go back to sleep to be fresh and beautiful for Miss Barkley.

I took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold water in the basin. While I rubbed myself with a towel I looked around the room and out the window and at Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed. He was good-looking, was my age, and he came from Amalfi. He loved being a surgeon and we were great friends. While I was looking at him he opened his eyes.

Have you any money?

Yes.

Loan me fifty lire.

I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall. Rinaldi took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and slid it in his breeches pocket. He smiled, I must make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth. You are my great and good friend and financial protector.

Go to hell, I said.

That night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he was disappointed and suddenly hurt that I had not gone to the Abruzzi. He had written to his father that I was coming and they had made preparations. I myself felt as badly as he did and could not understand why I had not gone. It was what I had wanted to do and I tried to explain how one thing had led to another and finally he saw it and understood that I had really wanted to go and it was almost all right. I had drunk much wine and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, winefully, how we did not do the things we wanted to do; we never did such things.

We two were talking while the others argued. I had wanted to go to Abruzzi. I had gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunting. I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of cafs and nights when the room whirled and you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost. Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now. But if you have had it you know. He had not had it but he understood that I had really wanted to go to the Abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends, with many tastes alike, but with the difference between us. He had always known what I did not know and what, when I learned it, I was always able to forget. But I did not know that then, although I learned it later. In the meantime we were all at the mess, the meal was finished, and the argument went on. We two stopped talking and the captain shouted, Priest not happy. Priest not happy without girls.

I am happy, said the priest.

Priest not happy. Priest wants Austrians to win the war, the captain said. The others listened. The priest shook his head.

No, he said.

Priest wants us never to attack. Dont you want us never to attack?

No. If there is a war I suppose we must attack.

Must attack. Shall attack!

The priest nodded.

Leave him alone, the major said. Hes all right.

He cant do anything about it anyway, the captain said. We all got up and left the table.

CHAPTER IV
The battery in the next garden woke me in the morning and I saw the sun coming through the window and got out of the bed. I went to the window and looked out. The gravel paths were moist and the grass was wet with dew. The battery fired twice and the air came each time like a blow and shook the window and made the front of my pajamas flap. I could not see the guns but they were evidently firing directly over us. It was a nuisance to have them there but it was a comfort that they were no bigger. As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor truck starting on the road. I dressed, went downstairs, had some coffee in the kitchen and went out to the garage.

Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long shed. They were top-heavy, blunt-nosed ambulances, painted gray and built like moving-vans. The mechanics were working on one out in the yard. Three others were up in the mountains at dressing stations.

Do they ever shell that battery? I asked one of the mechanics.

No, Signor Tenente. It is protected by the little hill.

Hows everything?

Not so bad. This machine is no good but the others march. He stopped working and smiled. Were you on permission?

Yes.

He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned. You have a good time? The others all grinned too.

Fine, I said. Whats the matter with this machine?

Its no good. One thing after another.

Whats the matter now?

New rings.

I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean, a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully, looking for cuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended to a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.

Has there been any trouble getting parts? I asked the sergeant mechanic.

No, Signor Tenente.

Where is the gasoline park now?

At the same place.

Good, I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of coffee at the mess table. The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed milk. Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning. There was that beginning of a feeling of dryness in the nose that meant the day would be hot later on. That day I visited the posts in the mountains and was back in town late in the afternoon.

The whole thing seemed to run better while I was away. The offensive was going to start again I heard. The division for which we worked were to attack at a place up the river and the major told me that I would see about the posts for during the attack. The attack would cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread up the hillside. The posts for the cars would have to be as near the river as they could get and keep covered. They would, of course, be selected by the infantry but we were supposed to work it out. It was one of those things that gave you a false feeling of soldiering.

I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash. Rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy of Hugos English grammar. He was dressed, wore his black boots, and his hair shone.

Splendid, he said when he saw me. You will come with me to see Miss Barkley.

No.

Yes. You will please come and make me a good impression on her.

All right. Wait till I get cleaned up.

Wash up and come as you are.

I washed, brushed my hair and we started.

Wait a minute, Rinaldi said. Perhaps we should have a drink. He opened his trunk and took out a bottle.

Not Strega, I said.

No. Grappa.

All right.

He poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended. The grappa was very strong.

Another?

All right, I said. We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the stairs. It was hot walking through the town but the sun was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. The British hospital was a big villa built by Germans before the war. Miss Barkley was in the garden. Another nurse was with her. We saw their white uniforms through the trees and walked toward them. Rinaldi saluted. I saluted too but more moderately.

How do you do? Miss Barkley said. Youre not an Italian, are you?

Oh, no.

Rinaldi was talking with the other nurse. They were laughing.

What an odd thingto be in the Italian army.

Its not really the army. Its only the ambulance.

Its very odd though. Why did you do it?

I dont know, I said. There isnt always an explanation for everything.

Oh, isnt there? I was brought up to think there was.

Thats awfully nice.

Do we have to go on and talk this way?

No, I said.

Thats a relief. Isnt it?

What is the stick? I asked. Miss Barkley was quite tall. She wore what seemed to me to be a nurses uniform, was blonde and had a tawny skin and gray eyes. I thought she was very beautiful. She was carrying a thin rattan stick like a toy riding-crop, bound in leather.

It belonged to a boy who was killed last year.

Im awfully sorry.

He was a very nice boy. He was going to marry me and he was killed in the Somme.

It was a ghastly show.

Were you there?

No.

Ive heard about it, she said. Theres not really any war of that sort down here. They sent me the little stick. His mother sent it to me. They returned it with his things.

Had you been engaged long?

Eight years. We grew up together.

And why didnt you marry?

I dont know, she said. I was a fool not to. I could have given him that anyway. But I thought it would be bad for him.

I see.

Have you ever loved any one?

No, I said.

We sat down on a bench and I looked at her.

You have beautiful hair, I said.

Do you like it?

Very much.

I was going to cut it all off when he died.

No.

I wanted to do something for him. You see I didnt care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didnt know.

I did not say anything.

I didnt know about anything then. I thought it would be worse for him. I thought perhaps he couldnt stand it and then of course he was killed and that was the end of it.

I dont know.

Oh, yes, she said. Thats the end of it.

We looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse.

What is her name?

Ferguson. Helen Ferguson. Your friend is a doctor, isnt he?

Yes. Hes very good.

Thats splendid. You rarely find any one any good this close to the front. This is close to the front, isnt it?

Quite.

Its a silly front, she said. But its very beautiful. Are they going to have an offensive?

Yes.

Then well have to work. Theres no work now.

Have you done nursing long?

Since the end of fifteen. I started when he did. I remember having a silly idea he might come to the hospital where I was. With a sabre cut, I suppose, and a bandage around his head. Or shot through the shoulder. Something picturesque.

This is the picturesque front, I said.

Yes, she said. People cant realize what France is like. If they did, it couldnt all go on. He didnt have a sabre cut. They blew him all to bits.

I didnt say anything.

Do you suppose it will always go on?

No.

Whats to stop it?

It will crack somewhere.

Well crack. Well crack in France. They cant go on doing things like the Somme and not crack.

They wont crack here, I said.

You think not?

No. They did very well last summer.

They may crack, she said. Anybody may crack.

The Germans too.

No, she said. I think not.

We went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson.

You love Italy? Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in English.

Quite well.

No understand, Rinaldi shook his head.

Abbastanza bene, I translated. He shook his head.

That is not good. You love England?

Not too well. Im Scotch, you see.

Rinaldi looked at me blankly.

Shes Scotch, so she loves Scotland better than England, I said in Italian.

But Scotland is England.

I translated this for Miss Ferguson.

Pas encore, said Miss Ferguson.

Not really?

Never. We do not like the English.

Not like the English? Not like Miss Barkley?

Oh, thats different. You mustnt take everything so literally.

After a while we said good-night and left. Walking home Rinaldi said, Miss Barkley prefers you to me. That is very clear. But the little Scotch one is very nice.

Very, I said. I had not noticed her. You like her?

No, said Rinaldi.

CHAPTER V
The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley again. She was not in the garden and I went to the side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up. Inside I saw the head nurse, who said Miss Barkley was on dutytheres a war on, you know.

I said I knew.

Youre the American in the Italian army? she asked.

Yes, maam.

How did you happen to do that? Why didnt you join up with us?

I dont know, I said. Could I join now?

Im afraid not now. Tell me. Why did you join up with the Italians?

I was in Italy, I said, and I spoke Italian.

Oh, she said. Im learning it. Its a beautiful language.

Somebody said you should be able to learn it in two weeks.

Oh, Ill not learn it in two weeks. Ive studied it for months now. You may come and see her after seven oclock if you wish. Shell be off then. But dont bring a lot of Italians.

Not even for the beautiful language?

No. Nor for the beautiful uniforms.

Good-evening, I said.

A rivederci, Tenente.

A rivederla. I saluted and went out. It was impossible to salute foreigners as an Italian, without embarrassment. The Italian salute never seemed made for export.

The day had been hot. I had been up the river to the bridgehead at Plava. It was there that the offensive was to begin. It had been impossible to advance on the far side the year before because there was only one road leading down from the pass to the pontoon bridge and it was under machine-gun and shell fire for nearly a mile. It was not wide enough either to carry all the transport for an offensive and the Austrians could make a shambles out of it. But the Italians had crossed and spread out a little way on the far side to hold about a mile and a half on the Austrian side of the river. It was a nasty place and the Austrians should not have let them hold it. I suppose it was mutual tolerance because the Austrians still kept a bridgehead further down the river. The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside only a few yards from the Italian lines. There had been a little town but it was all rubble. There was what was left of a railway station and a smashed permanent bridge that could not be repaired and used because it was in plain sight.

I went along the narrow road down toward the river, left the car at the dressing station under the hill, crossed the pontoon bridge, which was protected by a shoulder of the mountain, and went through the trenches in the smashed-down town and along the edge of the slope. Everybody was in the dugouts. There were racks of rockets standing to be touched off to call for help from the artillery or to signal with if the telephone wires were cut. It was quiet, hot and dirty. I looked across the wire at the Austrian lines. Nobody was in sight. I had a drink with a captain that I knew in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge.

A new wide road was being finished that would go over the mountain and zig-zag down to the bridge. When this road was finished the offensive would start. It came down through the forest in sharp turns. The system was to bring everything down the new road and take the empty trucks, carts and loaded ambulances and all returning traffic up the old narrow road. The dressing station was on the Austrian side of the river under the edge of the hill and stretcher-bearers would bring the wounded back across the pontoon bridge. It would be the same when the offensive started. As far as I could make out the last mile or so of the new road where it started to level out would be able to be shelled steadily by the Austrians. It looked as though it might be a mess. But I found a place where the cars would be sheltered after they had passed that last bad-looking bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought across the pontoon bridge. I would have liked to drive over the new road but it was not yet finished. It looked wide and well made with a good grade and the turns looked very impressive where you could see them through openings in the forest on the mountain side. The cars would be all right with their good metal-to-metal brakes and anyway, coming down, they would not be loaded. I drove back up the narrow road.

Two carabinieri held the car up. A shell had fallen and while we waited three others fell up the road. They were seventy-sevens and came with a whishing rush of air, a hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke that blew across the road. The carabinieri waved us to go on. Passing where the shells had landed I avoided the small broken places and smelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and stone and freshly shattered flint. I drove back to Gorizia and our villa and, as I said, went to call on Miss Barkley, who was on duty.

At dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa where the British had their hospital. It was really very large and beautiful and there were fine trees in the grounds. Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in the garden. Miss Ferguson was with her. They seemed glad to see me and in a little while Miss Ferguson excused herself and went away.

Ill leave you two, she said. You get along very well without me.

Dont go, Helen, Miss Barkley said.

Id really rather. I must write some letters.

Good-night, I said.

Good-night, Mr. Henry.

Dont write anything that will bother the censor.

Dont worry. I only write about what a beautiful place we live in and how brave the Italians are.

That way youll be decorated.

That will be nice. Good-night, Catherine.

Ill see you in a little while, Miss Barkley said. Miss Ferguson walked away in the dark.

Shes nice, I said.

Oh, yes, shes very nice. Shes a nurse.

Arent you a nurse?

Oh, no. Im something called a V. A. D. We work very hard but no one trusts us.

Why not?

They dont trust us when theres nothing going on. When there is really work they trust us.

What is the difference?

A nurse is like a doctor. It takes a long time to be. A V. A. D. is a short cut.

I see.

The Italians didnt want women so near the front. So were all on very special behavior. We dont go out.

I can come here though.

Oh, yes. Were not cloistered.

Lets drop the war.

Its very hard. Theres no place to drop it.

Lets drop it anyway.

All right.

We looked at each other in the dark. I thought she was very beautiful and I took her hand. She let me take it and I held it and put my arm around under her arm.

No, she said. I kept my arm where it was.

Why not?

No.

Yes, I said. Please. I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and there was a sharp stinging flash. She had slapped my face hard. Her hand had hit my nose and eyes, and tears came in my eyes from the reflex.

Im so sorry, she said. I felt I had a certain advantage.

You were quite right.

Im dreadfully sorry, she said. I just couldnt stand the nurses-evening-off aspect of it. I didnt mean to hurt you. I did hurt you, didnt I?

She was looking at me in the dark. I was angry and yet certain, seeing it all ahead like the moves in a chess game.

You did exactly right, I said. I dont mind at all.

Poor man.

You see Ive been leading a sort of a funny life. And I never even talk English. And then you are so very beautiful. I looked at her.

You dont need to say a lot of nonsense. I said I was sorry. We do get along.

Yes, I said. And we have gotten away from the war.

She laughed. It was the first time I had ever heard her laugh. I watched her face.

You are sweet, she said.

No, Im not.

Yes. You are a dear. Id be glad to kiss you if you dont mind.

I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and kissed her. I kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed tight. I was still angry and as I held her suddenly she shivered. I held her close against me and could feel her heart beating and her lips opened and her head went back against my hand and then she was crying on my shoulder.

Oh, darling, she said. You will be good to me, wont you?

What the hell, I thought. I stroked her hair and patted her shoulder. She was crying.

You will, wont you? She looked up at me. Because were going to have a strange life.

After a while I walked with her to the door of the villa and she went in and I walked home. Back at the villa I went upstairs to the room. Rinaldi was lying on his bed. He looked at me.

So you make progress with Miss Barkley?

We are friends.

You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat.

I did not understand the word.

Of a what?

He explained.

You, I said, have that pleasant air of a dog who

Stop it, he said. In a little while we would say insulting things. He laughed.

Good-night, I said.

Good-night, little puppy.

I knocked over his candle with the pillow and got into bed in the dark.

Rinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on reading."
153,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"Hurston, Zora Neale",b164_TheirEyesWereWatchingGod.txt,6,"Ships at a distance have every mans wish on board. For some they
come in with the tide. For others they sail forever on the horizon, never out of sight, never landing until the Watcher turns his eyes away in
resignation, his dreams mocked to death by Time. That is the life of
men.
Now, women forget all those things they dont want to remember,
and remember everything they dont want to forget. The dream is the
truth. Then they act and do things accordingly.
So the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from
burying the dead. Not the dead of sick and ailing with friends at the
pillow and the feet. She had come back from the sodden and the
bloated; the sudden dead, their eyes flung wide open in judgment.
The people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was
gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and
talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences
all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But
now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful
and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They
passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.
Seeing the woman as she was made them remember the envy they
had stored up from other times. So they chewed up the back parts of
their minds and swallowed with relish. They made burning statements
with questions, and killing tools out of laughs. It was mass cruelty. A
mood come alive. Words walking without masters; walking altogether
like harmony in a song.
What she doin coming back here in dem overhalls? Cant she find
no dress to put on?Wheres dat blue satin dress she left here
in?Where all dat money her husband took and died and left
her?What dat ole forty year ole oman doin wid her hair swingin
down her back lak some young gal?Where she left dat young lad of a
boy she went off here wid?Thought she was going to marry?Where
he left her?What he done wid all her money?Betcha he off wid
some gal so young she aint even got no hairswhy she dont stay in
her class?
When she got to where they were she turned her face on the
bander log and spoke. They scrambled a noisy good evenin  and left
their mouths setting open and their ears full of hope. Her speech was
pleasant enough, but she kept walking straight on to her gate. The
porch couldnt talk for looking.
The men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grapefruits in her
hip pockets; the great rope of black hair swinging to her waist and unraveling in the wind like a plume; then her pugnacious breasts trying
to bore holes in her shirt. They, the men, were saving with the mind
what they lost with the eye. The women took the faded shirt and
muddy overalls and laid them away for remembrance. It was a weapon
against her strength and if it turned out of no significance, still it was a
hope that she might fall to their level some day.
But nobody moved, nobody spoke, nobody even thought to swallow spit until after her gate slammed behind her.
Pearl Stone opened her mouth and laughed real hard because she
didnt know what else to do. She fell all over Mrs. Sumpkins while she
laughed. Mrs. Sumpkins snorted violently and sucked her teeth.
33/260
Humph! Yall let her worry yuh. You aint like me. Ah aint got her
to study bout. If she aint got manners enough to stop and let folks
know how she been makin out, let her gwan!
She aint even worth talkin after, Lulu Moss drawled through her
nose. She sits high, but she looks low. Dats what Ah say bout dese
ole women runnin after young boys.
Pheoby Watson hitched her rocking chair forward before she
spoke. Well, nobody dont know if its anything to tell or not. Me,
Ahm her best friend, and Ah dont know.
Maybe us dont know into things lak you do, but we all know how
she went way from here and us sho seen her come back. Taint no use
in your tryin to cloak no ole woman lak Janie Starks, Pheoby, friend
or no friend.
At dat she aint so ole as some of yall dats talking.
Shes way past forty to my knowledge, Pheoby.
No moren forty at de outside.
Shes way too old for a boy like Tea Cake.
Tea Cake aint been no boy for some time. Hes round thirty his
ownself.
Dont keer what it was, she could stop and say a few words with
us. She act like we done done something to her, Pearl Stone complained. She de one been doin wrong.
You mean, you mad cause she didnt stop and tell us all her business. Anyhow, what you ever know her to do so bad as yall make out?
34/260
The worst thing Ah ever knowed her to do was taking a few years offa
her age and dat aint never harmed nobody. Yall makes me tired. De
way you talkin youd think de folks in dis town didnt do nothin in de
bed cept praise de Lawd. You have to scuse me, cause Ahm bound to
go take her some supper. Pheoby stood up sharply.
Dont mind us, Lulu smiled, just go right ahead, us can mind yo
house for you till you git back. Mah supper is done. You bettah go see
how she feel. You kin let de rest of us know.
Lawd, Pearl agreed, Ah done scorched-up dat lil meat and bread
too long to talk about. Ah kin stay way from home long as Ah please.
Mah husband aint fussy.
Oh, er, Pheoby, if youse ready to go, Ah could walk over dere wid
you, Mrs. Sumpkins volunteered. Its sort of duskin down dark. De
booger man might ketch yuh.
Naw, Ah thank yuh. Nothin couldnt ketch me dese few steps
Ahm goin. Anyhow mah husband tell me say no first class booger
would have me. If she got anything to tell yuh, youll hear it.
Pheoby hurried on off with a covered bowl in her hands. She left
the porch pelting her back with unasked questions. They hoped the
answers were cruel and strange. When she arrived at the place, Pheoby
Watson didnt go in by the front gate and down the palm walk to the
front door. She walked around the fence corner and went in the intimate gate with her heaping plate of mulatto rice. Janie must be round
that side.
She found her sitting on the steps of the back porch with the lamps
all filled and the chimneys cleaned.
Hello, Janie, how you comin?
35/260
Aw, pretty good, Ahm tryin to soak some uh de tiredness and de
dirt outa mah feet. She laughed a little.
Ah see you is. Gal, you sho looks good. You looks like youse yo
own daughter. They both laughed. Even wid dem overhalls on, you
shows yo womanhood.
Gwan! Gwan! You must think Ah brought yuh somethin. When
Ah aint brought home a thing but mahself.
Dats a gracious plenty. Yo friends wouldnt want nothin better.
Ah takes dat flattery offa you, Pheoby, cause Ah know its from de
heart. Janie extended her hand. Good Lawd, Pheoby! aint you never
goin tuh gimme dat lil rations you brought me? Ah aint had a thing
on mah stomach today exceptin mah hand. They both laughed easily.
Give it here and have a seat.
Ah knowed youd be hongry. No time to be huntin stove wood
after dark. Mah mulatto rice aint so good dis time. Not enough bacon
grease, but Ah reckon itll kill hongry.
Ahll tell you in a minute, Janie said, lifting the cover. Gal, its
too good! you switches a mean fanny round in a kitchen.
Aw, dat aint much to eat, Janie. But Ahm liable to have
something sho nuff good tomorrow, cause you done come.
Janie ate heartily and said nothing. The varicolored cloud dust that
the sun had stirred up in the sky was settling by slow degrees.
Here, Pheoby, take yo ole plate. Ah aint got a bit of use for a
empty dish. Dat grub sho come in handy.
36/260
Pheoby laughed at her friends rough joke. Youse just as crazy as
you ever was.
Hand me dat wash-rag on dat chair by you, honey. Lemme scrub
mah feet. She took the cloth and rubbed vigorously. Laughter came to
her from the big road.
Well, Ah see Mouth-Almighty is still sittin in de same place. And
Ah reckon they got me up in they mouth now.
Yes indeed. You know if you pass some people and dont speak
tuh suit em dey got tuh go way back in yo life and see whut you ever
done. They know mo bout yuh than you do yo self. An envious heart
makes a treacherous ear. They done heard bout you just what they
hope done happened.
If God dont think no mo bout em then Ah do, theys a lost ball
in de high grass.
Ah hears what they say cause they just will collect round mah
porch cause its on de big road. Mah husband git so sick of em sometime he makes em all git for home.
Sam is right too. They just wearin out yo sittin chairs.
Yeah, Sam say most of em goes to church so theyll be sure to rise
in Judgment. Dats de day dat every secret is sposed to be made
known. They wants to be there and hear it all.
Sam is too crazy! You cant stop laughin when youse round him.
Uuh hunh. He says he aims to be there hisself so he can find out
who stole his corn-cob pipe."
154,“The Garden of Forking Paths.”,"Borges, Jorge Luis",b165_TheGardenofForkingPaths.txt,6,"Before unearthing this letter, I had questioned myself about the ways in which a book can be infinite. I could think of
nothing other than a cyclic volume, a circular one. A book whose last page was identical with the first, a book which
had the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I remembered too that night which is at the middle of the Thousand and
One Nights when Scheherazade (through a magical oversight of the copyist) begins to relate word for word the story
of the Thousand and One Nights, establishing the risk of coming once again to the night when she must repeat it, and
thus on to infinity. I imagined as well a Platonic, hereditary work, transmitted from father to son, in which each new
individual adds a chapter or corrects with pious care the pages of his elders. These conjectures diverted me; but none
seemed to correspond, not even remotely, to the contradictory chapters of Tsui Pen. In the midst of this perplexity, I
received from Oxford the manuscript you have examined. I lingered, naturally, on the sentence: I leave to the various
futures (not to all) my garden o f forking paths. Almost instantly, I understood: `the garden of forking paths was the
chaotic novel; the phrase `the various futures (not to all) suggested to me the forking in time, not in space. A broad
rereading of the work confirmed the theory. In all fictional works, each time a man is confronted with several alternatives, he chooses one and eliminates the others; in the fiction of Tsui Pen, he chooses simultaneously-all of them. He
creates, in this way, diverse futures, diverse times which themselves also proliferate and fork. Here, then, is the explanation of the novels contradictions. Fang, let us say, has a secret; a stranger calls at his door; Fang resolves to kill
him. Naturally, there are several possible outcomes: Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, they both can
escape, they both can die, and so forth. In the work of Tsui Pen, all possible outcomes occur; each one is the point of
departure for other forkings. Sometimes, the paths of this labyrinth converge: for example, you arrive at this house,
but in one of the possible pasts you are my enemy, in another, my friend. If you will resign yourself to my incurable
pronunciation, we shall read a few pages."
155,The Adventures of Augie March,"Bellow, Saul",b166_TheAdventuresofAugieMarch.txt,6,"“I haven’t been wasting my time,” he said. “I’ve been working on something. I think I’m getting married soon,” he said,
and didn’t allow himself to smile with the announcement or temper it in some pleasant way.
“When? To whom?”
“To a woman with money.”
“A woman? An older woman?” That was how I interpreted it.
“Well, what’s the matter with you? Yes, I’d marry an older woman. Why not?”
“I bet you wouldn’t.” He was still able to amaze me, as though we had remained kids.
“We don’t have to argue about it because she’s not old. She’s about twenty-two, I’m told.”
“By whom? And you haven’t even seen her?”
“No, I haven’t. You remember the buyer, my old boss? He’s fixing me up. I have her picture. She’s not bad. Heavy—but
I’m getting heavy too. She’s sort of pretty. Anyhow, even if she weren’t pretty, and if the buyer isn’t lying about the
dough—her family is supposed to have a mountain of dough—I’d marry her.”
“You’ve already made up your mind?”
“I’ll say I have!”
“And suppose she doesn’t want to marry you?”
“I’ll see that she does. Don’t you think I can?”
“Maybe you can, but I don’t like it. It’s cold-blooded.”
“Cold-blooded!” he said with sudden emotion. “What’s cold-blooded about it? I’d be cold-blooded if I stayed as I am.
I see around this marriage and beyond it. I’ll never again go for all the nonsense about marriage. Everybody you lay
eyes on, except perhaps a few like you and me, is born of marriage. Do you see anything so exceptional or wonderful
about it that it makes it such a big deal? Why be fooling around to make this perfect great marriage? What’s it going
to save you from? Has it saved anybody—the jerks, the fools, the morons, the schleppers, the jag-offs, the monkeys,
rats, rabbits, or the decent unhappy people or what you call nice people? They’re all married or are born of marriages,
so how can you pretend to me that it makes a difference that Bob loves Mary who loves Jerry? That’s for the movies.
Don’t you see people pondering how to marry for love and getting the blood gypped out of them? Because while 
they’re looking for the best there is—and I figure that’s what’s wrong with you—everything else gets lost. It’s sad. It’s a
pity, but it’s that way.”
I was all the same strongly against him; that he saw. Even if I couldn’t just then consider myself on the active list of
lovers and wasn’t carrying a live torch any more for Esther Fenchel. I recognized his face as the face of a man in the
wrong."
156,The Bluest Eye,"Morrison, Toni",b167_TheBluestEye.txt,6,"One winter Pauline discovered she was pregnant. When
she told Cholly, he surprised her by being pleased. He began
to drink less and come home more often. They eased back
into a relationship more like the early days of their marriage, when he asked if she were tired or wanted him to
bring her something from the store. In this state of ease,
Pauline stopped doing day work and returned to her own
housekeeping. But the loneliness in those two rooms had not
gone away. When the winter sun hit the peeling green paint
of the kitchen chairs, when the smoked hocks were boiling
in the pot, when all she could hear was the truck delivering
furniture downstairs, she thought about back home, about
how she had been all alone most of the time then too, but
that this lonesomeness was different. Then she stopped staring at the green chairs, at the delivery truck; she went to the
movies instead. There in the dark her memory was refreshed, and she succumbed to her earlier dreams. Along
with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to
anotherphysical beauty. Probably the most destructive
ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in
envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion. In
equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind,
bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap. She forgot lust and simple caring for. She regarded love as possessive mating, and romance as the goal of the spirit. It would
be for her a well-spring from which she would draw the
most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking
to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way.
She was never able, after her education in the movies, to
look at a face and not assign it some category in the scale of
absolute beauty, and the scale was one she absorbed in full
from the silver screen. There at last were the darkened
woods, the lonely roads, the river banks, the gentle knowing
eyes. There the flawed became whole, the blind sighted, and
the lame and halt threw away their crutches. There death
was dead, and people made every gesture in a cloud of
music. There the black-and-white images came together,
making a magnificent wholeall projected through the ray
of light from above and behind.
It was really a simple pleasure, but she learned all there
was to love and all there was to hate."
157,Dreaming in Cuban,"Garcia, Cristina",b168_DreaminginCuban.txt,6,"Abuela gives me a box of letters she wrote to her onetime lover in Spain, but never sent. She shows me his photograph, too. It’s very well preserved. He’d be good-looking by today’s standards, well built with a full beard and kind
eyes, almost professorial. He wore a crisp linen suit and a boater tilted slightly to the left. Abuela tells me she took the
picture herself one Sunday on the Malecón,
She also gives me a book of poems she’s had since 1930, we she heard García Lorca read at the Principal de la Comedia Theater. Abuela knows each poem by heart, and recites them quite dramatically.
I’ve started dreaming in Spanish, which has never happened before. I wake up feeling different, like something inside
me is changing, something chemical and irreversible. There’s a magic here working its way through my veins. There’s
something about the vegetation, too, that I respond to instinctively—the stunning bougainvillea, the flamboyants and
jacarandas, the orchids growing from the trunks of the mysterious ceiba trees. And I love Havana, its noise and decay
and painted ladyness. I could happily sit on one of those wrought-iron balconies for days, or keep my grandmother
company on her porch, with its ringside view of the sea. I’m afraid to lose all this. To lose Abuela Celia again. But I
know that sooner or later I’d have to return to New York."
158,The Namesake,"Lahiri, Jhumpa",b169_TheNamesake.txt,6,"One day he attends a panel discussion about Indian novels written in English. He feels obligated to attend; one of
the presenters on the panel, Amit, is a distant cousin who lives in Bombay, whom Gogol has never met. His mother
has asked him to greet Amit on her behalf. Gogol is bored by the panelists, who keep referring to something called
marginality, as if it were some sort of medical condition. For most of the hour, he sketches portraits of the panelists,
who sit hunched over their papers along a rectangular table. Teleologically speaking, ABCDs are unable to answer
the question Where are you from? the sociologist on the panel declares. Gogol has never heard the term ABCD. He
eventually gathers that it stands for American-born confused deshi. In other words, him. He learns that the C could
also stand for conflicted. He knows that deshi, a generic word for countryman, means Indian, knows that his
parents and all their friends always refer to India simply as desh. But Gogol never thinks of India as desh. He thinks of
it as Americans do, as India.
Gogol slouches in his seat and ponders certain awkward truths. For instance, although he can understand his mother 
tongue, and speak it fluently, he cannot read or write it with even modest proficiency. On trips to India his Americanaccented English is a source of endless amusement to his relatives, and when he and Sonia speak to each other, aunts
and uncles and cousins always shake their heads in disbelief and say, I didnt understand a word! Living with a pet
name and a good name, in a place where such distinctions do not existsurely that was emblematic of the greatest
confusion of all. He searches the audience for someone he knows, but it isnt his crowdlots of lit majors with leather
satchels and gold-rimmed glasses and fountain pens, lots of people Ruth would have waved to. There are also lots of
ABCDs. He has no idea there are this many on campus. He has no ABCD friends at college. He avoids them, for they
remind him too much of the way his parents choose to live, befriending people not so much because they like them,
but because of a past they happen to share. Gogol, why arent you a member of the Indian association here? Amit
asks later when they go for a drink at the Anchor. I just dont have the time, Gogol says, not telling his well-meaning
cousin that he can think of no greater hypocrisy than joining an organization that willingly celebrates occasions his
parents forced him, throughout his childhood and adolescence, to attend. Im Nikhil now, Gogol says, suddenly
depressed by how many more times he will have to say this, asking people to remember, reminding them to forget,
feeling as if an errata slip were perpetually pinned to his chest."
159,Common Sense,"Paine, Thomas",b170_CommonSense.txt,6,"A government of our own is our natural right: And when a man seriously reflects on the precariousness of human
affairs, he will become convinced, that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a constitution of our own in a cool
deliberate manner, while we have it in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance. If we
omit it now, some Massenello may hereafter arise, who laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the
desperate and the discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers of government, may sweep away the
liberties of the continent like a deluge. Should the government of America return again into the hands of Britain, the
tottering situation of things, will be a temptation for some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in such a case,
what relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the news the fatal business might be done, and ourselves suffering like
the wretched Britons under the oppression of the Conqueror. Ye that oppose independence now, ye know not what
ye do; ye are opening a door to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government."
160,The Declaration of Independence,"Jefferson, Thomas",b171_TheDeclarationofIndependence.txt,6,"IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these
rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,—That
whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off
such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.—Such has been the patient sufferance of these
Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
 He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
 He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
operation till his
 Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
 He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would
relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
 He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of
their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
 He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights
of the people.
 He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative
Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the
mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
 He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new
Appropriations of Lands.
 He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.
 He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of
their salaries.
 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out
their substance.
 He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
 He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.
 He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by
our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:
 For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
 For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
 For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
 For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:
 For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
 For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
 For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary
government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the
same absolute rule into these Colonies:
 For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our
Governments:
 For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases
whatsoever.
 He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
 He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
 He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and
tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and
totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.
 He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to be-
come the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
 He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes
and conditions.
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions
have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define
a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.
Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts
by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of
our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured
them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies
in War, in Peace Friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the
Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good
People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free
and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all
other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do."

162,Walden,"Thoreau, Henry David",b173_Walden.txt,6,"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish 68 to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify God and enjoy him forever. Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quick-sands and thousand-andone items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its so called internal improvements, which, by the way, are all external and superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in the land; and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is essential that the Nation have commerce, and export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt, whether they do or not; but whether we should live 69 like baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them, who will build railroads? And if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irishman, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again. Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine to-morrow. As for work, we havent any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it known, did not set it on fire,or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a man takes a half hours nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks, Whats the news? as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every half hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a nights sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast. Pray tell me any thing new that has happened to a man any where on this globe,and he reads it over his coffee and rolls, 70 that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself. For my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never received more than one or two letters in my lifeI wrote this some years agothat were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter,we never need read of another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure,news which I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right proportions,they may have changed the names a little since I saw the papers,and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact state or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers: and as for England, almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted. What news! How much more important to know what that is which was never old! Kieou-pe-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent 71 a man to Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy messenger! The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the week,for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new one,with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice,Pause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow? Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence,that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit every where, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo book, that there was a kings son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his fathers ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul, continues the Hindoo philosopher, from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme. I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things. We think that that is which appears to be. If a man should walk through this town and see only 72 the reality, where, think you, would the Mill-dam go to? If he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality which surrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it. Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails. Let us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without perturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children cry,determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is down hill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they are like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through church and state, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a point dappui, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or set a lamp-post safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a 73 Realometer, that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business. Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use their snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so by the divining rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will begin to mine."
163,“Society and Solitude.”,"Emerson, Ralph Waldo",b174_SocietyandSolitude.txt,6,"Tis hard to mesmerize ourselves, to whip our own top; but through sympathy we are capable of energy and endurance. Concert fires people to a certain fury of performance they can rarely reach alone. Here is the use of society: it is
so easy with the great to be great; so easy to come up to an existing standard;as easy as it is to the lover to swim to
his maiden through waves so grim before. The benefits of affection are immense; and the one event which never loses
its romance, is the encounter with superior persons on terms allowing the happiest intercourse.
It by no means follows that we are not fit for society, because soires are tedious, and because the soire finds us
tedious. A backwoodsman, who had been sent to the university, told me that, when he heard the best-bred young
men at the law school talk together, he reckoned himself a boor; but whenever he caught them apart, and had one to
himself alone, then they were the boors, and he the better man. And if we recall the rare hours when we encountered
the best persons, we then found ourselves, and then first society seemed to exist. That was society, though in the
transom of a brig, or on the Florida Keys.
A cold, sluggish blood thinks it has not facts enough to the purpose, and must decline its turn in the conversation.
But they who speak have no more,have less. Tis not new facts that avail, but the heat to dissolve everybodys facts.
The capital defect of cold, arid natures is the want of animal spirits. They seem a power incredible, as if God should
raise the dead. The recluse witnesses what others perform by their aid, with a kind of fear. It is as much out of his
possibility as the prowess of Cur-de-Lion, or an Irishmans days-work on the railroad. Tis said, the present and the
future are always rivals. Animal spirits constitute the power of the present, and their feats are like the structure of a
pyramid. Their result is a lord, a general, or a boon companion. Before these, what a base mendicant is Memory with
his leathern badge! But this genial heat is latent in all constitutions, and is disengaged only by the friction of society.
As Bacon said of manners, To obtain them, it only needs not to despise them, so we say of animal spirits, that they
are the spontaneous product of health and of a social habit. For behavior, men learn it, as they take diseases, one of
another.
But the people are to be taken in very small doses. If solitude is proud, so is society vulgar. In society, high advantages are set down to the individual as disqualifications. We sink as easily as we rise, through sympathy. So many men
whom I know are degraded by their sympathies, their native aims being high enough, but their relation all too tender
to the gross people about them. Men cannot afford to live together by their merits, and they adjust themselves by
their demerits,by their love of gossip, or by sheer tolerance and animal good-nature. They untune and dissipate the
brave aspirant.
The remedy is, to reinforce each of these moods from the other. Conversation will not corrupt us, if we come to the
assembly in our own garb and speech, and with the energy of health to select what is ours and reject what is not.
Society we must have; but let it be society, and not exchanging news, or eating from the same dish. Is it society to sit
in one of your chairs? I cannot go into the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone. Society
exists by chemical affinity, and not otherwise.
Put any company of people together with freedom for conversation, and a rapid self-distribution takes place, into
sets and pairs. The best are accused of exclusiveness. It would be more true to say, they separate as oil from water,
as children from old people, without love or hatred in the matter, each seeking his like; and any interference with the
affinities would produce constraint and suffocation. All conversation is a magnetic experiment. I know that my friend
can talk eloquently; you know that he cannot articulate a sentence: we have seen him in different company. Assort
your party, or invite none. Put Stubbs and Coleridge, Quintilian and Aunt Miriam, into pairs, and you make them all
wretched. Tis an extempore Sing-Sing built in a parlor. Leave them to seek their own mates, and they will be as merry
as sparrows.
A higher civility will re-establish in our customs a certain reverence which we have lost. What to do with these brisk
young men who break through all fences, and make themselves at home in every house? I find out in an instant if my
companion does not want me, and ropes cannot hold me when my welcome is gone. One would think that the affinities would pronounce themselves with a surer reciprocity.
Here again, as so often, Nature delights to put us between extreme antagonisms, and our safety is in the skill with
which we keep the diagonal line. Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal. We must keep our head in the one and
our hands in the other. The conditions are met, if we keep our independence, yet do not lose our sympathy. These
wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands. We require such a solitude as shall hold us to its revelations when
we are in the street and in palaces; for most men are cowed in society, and say good things to you in private, but will
not stand to them in public. But let us not be the victims of words. Society and solitude are deceptive names. It is not
the circumstance of seeing more or fewer people, but the readiness of sympathy, that imports; and a sound mind will
derive its principles from insight, with ever a purer ascent to the sufficient and absolute right, and will accept society
as the natural element in which they are to be applied."
164,"“Lee Surrenders to Grant, April 9th, 1865.”","Porter, Horace",b175_LeeSurrenderstoGrantAprilth.txt,6,"They consisted of two pages. When he reached the top line of the second page, he looked up, and said to General Grant: ""After the words 'until properly' the word 'exchanged' seems to be omitted. You doubtless intended to use that word."" 

""Why, yes,"" said Grant; "" I thought I had put in the word 'exchanged.'"" 

""I presumed it had been omitted inadvertently,"" continued Lee; ""and, with your permission, I will mark where it should be inserted.""  

""Certainly,"" Grant replied.

Lee felt in his pocket as if searching for a pencil, but he did not seem to be able to find one. Seeing this, I handed him my lead-pencil. During the rest of the interview he kept twirling this pencil in his fingers and occasionally tapping the top of the table with it. When he handed it back, it was carefully treasured by me as a memento of the occasion. When Lee came to the sentence about the officers' side-arms, private horses, and baggage, he showed for the first time during the reading of the letter a slight change of countenance, and was evidently touched by this act of generosity. It was doubtless the condition mentioned to which he particularly alluded when he looked toward General Grant, as he finished reading, and said with some degree of warmth in his manner, ""This will have a very happy effect upon my army."" 

General Grant then said: ""Unless you have some suggestions to make in regard to the form in which I have stated the terms, I will have a copy of the letter made in ink, and sign it."" 


Previous Page	5 of 10	Next Page
 	 	 
""There is one thing I should like to mention,"" Lee replied, after a short pause. ""The cavalrymen and artillerists own their own horses in our army. Its organization in this respect differs from that of the United States."" This expression attracted the notice of our officers present, as showing how firmly the conviction was grounded in his mind that we were two distinct countries. He continued: ""I should like to understand whether these men will be permitted to retain their horses."" 

""You will find that the terms as written do not allow this,"" General Grant replied; ""only the officers are permitted to take their private property."" 

Lee read over the second page of the letter again, and then said: ""No, I see the terms do not allow it; that is clear."" His face showed plainly that he was quite anxious to have this concession made; and Grant said very promptly, and without, giving Lee time to make a direct request: 

""Well, the subject is quite new to me. Of course I did not know that any private soldiers owned their animals; but I think we have fought the last battle of the war,—I sincerely hope so,—and that the surrender of this army will be followed soon by that of all the others; and I take it that most of the men in the ranks are small farmers, and as the country has been so raided by the two armies, it is doubtful whether they will be able to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter without the aid of the horses they are now riding, and I will arrange it in this way: I will not change the terms as now written, but I will instruct the officers I shall appoint to receive the paroles to let all the men who claim to own a horse or mule take the animals home with them to work their little farms."" (This expression has been quoted in various forms, and has been the subject of some dispute. I give the exact words used.)

Lee now looked greatly relieved, and though anything but a demonstrative man, he gave every evidence of his appreciation of this concession, and said: ""This will have the best possible effect upon the men. It will be very gratifying, and will do much toward conciliating our people."" He handed the draft of the terms back to General Grant, who called Colonel T. S. Bowers of the staff to him, and directed him to make a copy in ink. Bowers was a little nervous, and he turned the matter over to Colonel Parker, whose handwriting presented a better appearance than that of any one else on the staff. Parker sat down to write at the oval table, which he had moved again to the rear of the room, Wilmer McLean's domestic resources in the way of ink now became the subject of a searching investigation, but it was found that the contents of the conical-shaped stoneware inkstand with a paper stopper which he produced appeared to be participating in the general breaking up, and had disappeared. Colonel Marshall now came to the rescue, and took from his pocket a small boxwood inkstand, which was put at Parker's service, so that, after all, we had to fall back upon the resources of the enemy to furnish the ""stage properties"" for the final scene in the memorable military drama.

Colonel Marshall then took a seat on the sofa beside  Sheridan and Ingalls. When the terms had been copied, Lee directed his military secretary to draw up for his signature a letter of acceptance. Colonel Marshall wrote out a draft of such a letter, making it formal, beginning with, ""I have the honor to acknowledge,'' etc. General Lee took it, and after reading it over very carefully, directed that these formal expressions be stricken out, and that the letter be otherwise shortened. He afterward went over it again, and seemed to change some words, and then told the colonel to make a final copy in ink. When it came to providing the paper, it was found that we had the only supply of that important ingredient in the recipe for surrendering an army, so we gave a few pages to the colonel. "
165,“The Fallacy of Success.”,"Chesterton, G. K.",b176_TheFallacyofSuccess.txt,6,"There has appeared in our time a particular class of books and articles which I sincerely and solemnly think may be
called the silliest ever known among men. They are much more wild than the wildest romances of chivalry and much
more dull than the dullest religious tract. Moreover, the romances of chivalry were at least about chivalry; the religious tracts are about religion. But these things are about nothing; they are about what is called Success. On every
bookstall, in every magazine, you may find works telling people how to succeed. They are books showing men how to
succeed in everything; they are written by men who cannot even succeed in writing books. To begin with, of course,
there is no such thing as Success. Or, if you like to put it so, there is nothing that is not successful. That a thing is successful merely means that it is; a millionaire is successful in being a millionaire and a donkey in being a donkey. Any
live man has succeeded in living; any dead man may have succeeded in committing suicide. But, passing over the
bad logic and bad philosophy in the phrase, we may take it, as these writers do, in the ordinary sense of success in
obtaining money or worldly position. These writers profess to tell the ordinary man how he may succeed in his trade
or speculation—how, if he is a builder, he may succeed as a builder; how, if he is a stockbroker, he may succeed as a
stockbroker. They profess to show him how, if he is a grocer, he may become a sporting yachtsman; how, if he is a
tenth-rate journalist, he may become a peer; and how, if he is a German Jew, he may become an Anglo-Saxon. This
is a definite and business-like proposal, and I really think that the people who buy these books (if any people do buy
them) have a moral, if not a legal, right to ask for their money back. Nobody would dare to publish a book about electricity which literally told one nothing about electricity; no one would dare publish an article on botany which showed
that the writer did not know which end of a plant grew in the earth. Yet our modern world is full of books about Success and successful people which literally contain no kind of idea, and scarcely and kind of verbal sense.
It is perfectly obvious that in any decent occupation (such as bricklaying or writing books) there are only two ways (in
any special sense) of succeeding. One is by doing very good work, the other is by cheating. Both are much too simple
to require any literary explanation. If you are in for the high jump, either jump higher than any one else, or manage
somehow to pretend that you have done so. If you want to succeed at whist, either be a good whist-player, or play
with marked cards. You may want a book about jumping; you may want a book about whist; you may want a book
about cheating at whist. But you cannot want a book about Success. Especially you cannot want a book about Success such as those which you can now find scattered by the hundred about the book-market. You may want to jump
or to play cards; but you do not want to read wandering statements to the effect that jumping is jumping, or that
games are won by winners. If these writers, for instance, said anything about success in jumping it would be something like this: ‘The jumper must have a clear aim before him. He must desire definitely to jump higher than the other
men who are in for the same competition. He must let no feeble feelings of mercy (sneaked from the sickening Little
Englanders and Pro-Boers) prevent him from trying to do his best. He must remember that a competition in jumping
is distinctly competitive, and that, as Darwin has gloriously demonstrated, THE WEAKEST GO TO THE WALL.’ That is
the kind of thing the book would say, and very useful it would be, no doubt, if read out in a low and tense voice to a
young man just about to take the high jump. Or suppose that in the course of his intellectual rambles the philosopher
of Success dropped upon our other case, that of playing cards, his bracing advice would run—’In playing cards it is
very necessary to avoid the mistake (commonly made by maudlin humanitarians and Free Traders) of permitting your
opponent to win the game. You must have grit and snap and go in to win. The days of idealism and superstition are
over. We live in a time of science and hard common sense, and it has now been definitely proved that in any game
where two are playing IF ONE DOES NOT WIN THE OTHER WILL.’ It is all very stirring, of course; but I confess that if I
were playing cards I would rather have some decent little book which told me the rules of the game. "
166,"The American Language, 4th Edition","Mencken, H. L. ",b177_TheAmericanLanguagethEdition.txt,6,"American Slang—This neglect of the national proverbial philosophy extends to the national slang. There is but one work, so far as I can discover, formally devoted to it,[3] and that work is extremely superficial. Moreover, it has been long out of date, and hence is of little save historical value. There are at least a dozen careful treatises on French slang,[4] half as many on English slang,[5] and a good many on German slang, but American slang, which is probably quite as rich as that of France and a good deal richer than that of any other country, is yet to be studied at length. Nor is there much discussion of it, of any interest or value, in the general philological literature. Fowler and all the other early native students of the language dismissed it with lofty gestures; down to the time of Whitney it was scarcely regarded as a seemly subject for the notice of a man of learning. Lounsbury, less pedantic, viewed its phenomena more hospitably, and even defined it as ""the source from which the decaying energies of speech are constantly refreshed,"" and Brander Matthews, following him, has described its function as that of providing ""substitutes for the good words and true which are worn out by hard service.""[6] But that is about as far as the investigation has got. Krapp has some judicious paragraphs upon the matter in his ""Modern English,""[7] there are a few scattered essays upon the underlying psychology,[8] and various uninforming magazine articles, but that is all. The practising authors of the country, like its philologians, have always shown [Pg305] a gingery and suspicious attitude. ""The use of slang,"" said Oliver Wendell Holmes, ""is at once a sign and a cause of mental atrophy."" ""Slang,"" said Ambrose Bierce fifty years later, ""is the speech of him who robs the literary garbage carts on their way to the dumps."" Literature in America, as we have seen, remains aloof from the vulgate. Despite the contrary examples of Mark Twain and Howells, all the more pretentious American authors try to write chastely and elegantly; the typical literary product of the country is still a refined essay in the Atlantic Monthly, perhaps gently jocose but never rough—by Emerson, so to speak, out of Charles Lamb—the sort of thing one might look to be done by a somewhat advanced English curate. George Ade, undoubtedly one of the most adept anatomists of the American character and painters of the American scene that the national literature has yet developed, is neglected because his work is grounded firmly upon the national speech—not that he reports it literally, like Lardner and the hacks trailing after Lardner, but that he gets at and exhibits its very essence. It would stagger a candidate for a doctorate in philology, I daresay, to be told off by his professor to investigate the slang of Ade in the way that Bosson,[9] the Swede, has investigated that of Jerome K. Jerome, and yet, until something of the sort is undertaken, American philology will remain out of contact with the American language.
Most of the existing discussions of slang spend themselves upon efforts to define it, and, in particular, upon efforts to differentiate it from idiomatic neologisms of a more legitimate type. This effort is largely in vain; the border-line is too vague and wavering to be accurately mapped; words and phrases are constantly crossing it, and in both directions. There was a time, perhaps, when the familiar American counter-word, proposition, was slang; its use seems to have originated in the world of business, and it was soon afterward adopted by the sporting fraternity. But today it is employed without much feeling that it needs apology, and surely without any feeling that it is low. [Pg306] Nice, as an adjective of all work, was once in slang use only; today no one would question ""a nice day,"" or ""a nice time"" or ""a nice hotel."" Awful seems to be going the same route. ""Awful sweet"" and ""awfully dear"" still seem slangy and school-girlish, but ""awful children,"" ""awful weather"" and ""an awful job"" have entirely sound support, and no one save a pedant would hesitate to use them. Such insidious purifications and consecrations of slang are going on under our noses all the time. The use of some as a general adjective-adverb seems likely to make its way in the same manner. It is constantly forgotten by purists of defective philological equipment that a great many of our most respectable words and phrases originated in the plainest sort of slang. Thus, quandary, despite a fanciful etymology which would identify it with wandreth (=evil), is probably simply a composition form of the French phrase, qu'en dirai-je? Again, to turn to French itself, there is tête, a sound name for the human head for many centuries—though its origin was in the Latin testa (=pot), a favorite slang-word of the soldiers of the decaying empire, analogous to our own block, nut and conch. The word slacker, recently come into good usage in the United States as a designation for an unsuccessful shirker of conscription, is a substantive derived from the English verb to slack, which was born as university slang and remains so to this day. Brander Matthews, so recently as 1901, thought to hold up slang; it is now perfectly good American.

The contrary movement of words from the legitimate vocabulary into slang is constantly witnessed. Some one devises a new and intriguing trope or makes use of an old one under circumstances arresting the public attention, and at once it is adopted into slang, given a host of remote significances, and ding-donged ad nauseam. The Rooseveltian phrases, muck-raker, Ananias Club, short and ugly word, nature-faker and big-stick, offer examples. Not one of them was new and not one of them was of much pungency, but Roosevelt's vast talent for delighting the yokelry threw about them a charming air, and so they entered into current slang and were mouthed idiotically for months. Another example is to be found in steam-roller. [Pg307] It was first heard of in June, 1908, when it was applied by Oswald F. Schuette, of the Chicago Inter-Ocean, to the methods employed by the Roosevelt-Taft majority in the Republican National Committee in over-riding the protests against seating Taft delegates from Alabama and Arkansas. At once it struck the popular fancy and was soon heard on all sides. All the usual derivatives appeared, to steam-roller, steam-rollered, and so on. Since then, curiously enough, the term has gradually forced its way back from slang to good usage, and even gone over to England. In the early days of the Great War it actually appeared in the most solemn English reviews, and once or twice, I believe, in state papers.

Much of the discussion of slang by popular etymologists is devoted to proofs that this or that locution is not really slang at all—that it is to be found in Shakespeare, in Milton, or in the Revised Version. These scientists, of course, overlook the plain fact that slang, like the folk-song, is not the creation of people in the mass, but of definite individuals, and that its character as slang depends entirely upon its adoption by the ignorant, who use its novelties too assiduously and with too little imagination, and so debase them to the estate of worn-out coins, smooth and valueless. It is this error, often shared by philologists of sounder information, that lies under the doctrine that the plays of Shakespeare are full of slang, and that the Bard showed but a feeble taste in language. Nothing could be more absurd. The business of writing English, in his day, was unharassed by the proscriptions of purists, and so the vocabulary could be enriched more facilely than today, but though Shakespeare and his fellow-dramatists quickly adopted such neologisms as to bustle, to huddle, bump, hubbub and pat, it goes without saying that they exercised a sound discretion and that the slang of the Bankside was full of words and phrases which they were never tempted to use. In our own day the same discrimination is exercised by all writers of sound taste. On the one hand they disregard the senseless prohibitions of school-masters, and on the other hand they draw the line with more or less watchfulness, according as they are of conservative or liberal habit. I [Pg308] find the best of the bunch and joke-smith in Saintsbury;[10] one could scarcely imagine either in Walter Pater. But by the same token one could not imagine chicken (for young girl),[11] aber nit, to come across or to camouflage in Saintsbury.

What slang actually consists of doesn't depend, in truth, upon intrinsic qualities, but upon the surrounding circumstances. It is the user that determines the matter, and particularly the user's habitual way of thinking. If he chooses words carefully, with a full understanding of their meaning and savor, then no word that he uses seriously will belong to slang, but if his speech is made up chiefly of terms poll-parroted, and he has no sense of their shades and limitations, then slang will bulk largely in his vocabulary. In its origin it is nearly always respectable; it is devised not by the stupid populace, but by individuals of wit and ingenuity; as Whitney says, it is a product of an ""exuberance of mental activity, and the natural delight of language-making."" But when its inventions happen to strike the popular fancy and are adopted by the mob, they are soon worn thread-bare and so lose all piquancy and significance, and, in Whitney's words, become ""incapable of expressing anything that is real.""[12] This is the history of such slang phrases, often interrogative, as ""How'd you like to be the ice-man?"" ""How's your poor feet?"" ""Merci pour la langouste,"" ""Have a heart,"" ""This is the life,"" ""Where did you get that hat?"" ""Would you for fifty cents?"" ""Let her go, Gallegher,"" ""Shoo-fly, don't bother me,"" ""Don't wake him up"" and ""Let George do it."" The last well exhibits the process. It originated in France, as ""Laissez faire à Georges,"" during the fifteenth century, and at the start had satirical reference to the multiform activities of Cardinal Georges d'Amboise, prime minister to Louis XII.[13] It later [Pg309] became common slang, was translated into English, had a revival during the early days of David Lloyd-George's meteoric career, was adopted into American without any comprehension of either its first or its latest significance, and enjoyed the brief popularity of a year.

Krapp attempts to distinguish between slang and sound idiom by setting up the doctrine that the former is ""more expressive than the situation demands."" ""It is,"" he says, ""a kind of hyperesthesia in the use of language. To laugh in your sleeve is idiom because it arises out of a natural situation; it is a metaphor derived from the picture of one raising his sleeve to his face to hide a smile, a metaphor which arose naturally enough in early periods when sleeves were long and flowing; but to talk through your hat is slang, not only because it is new, but also because it is a grotesque exaggeration of the truth.""[14] The theory, unluckily, is combated by many plain facts. To hand it to him, to get away with it and even to hand him a lemon are certainly not metaphors that transcend the practicable and probable, and yet all are undoubtedly slang. On the other hand, there is palpable exaggeration in such phrases as ""he is not worth the powder it would take to kill him,"" in such adjectives as break-bone (fever), and in such compounds as fire-eater, and yet it would be absurd to dismiss them as slang. Between block-head and bone-head there is little to choose, but the former is sound English, whereas the latter is American slang. So with many familiar similes, e. g., like greased lightning, as scarce as hen's teeth; they are grotesque hyperboles, but surely not slang.

The true distinction between slang and more seemly idiom, in so far as any distinction exists at all, is that indicated by Whitney. Slang originates in an effort, always by ingenious individuals, to make the language more vivid and expressive. When in the form of single words it may appear as new metaphors, [Pg310] e. g., bird and peach; as back formations, e. g., beaut and flu; as composition-forms, e. g., whatdyecallem; as picturesque compounds, e. g., booze-foundry; as onomatopes, e. g., biff and zowie; or in any other of the shapes that new terms take. If, by the chances that condition language-making, it acquires a special and limited meaning, not served by any existing locution, it enters into sound idiom and is presently wholly legitimatized; if, on the contrary, it is adopted by the populace as a counter-word and employed with such banal imitativeness that it soon loses any definite significance whatever, then it remains slang and is avoided by the finical. An example of the former process is afforded by Tommy-rot. It first appeared as English school-boy slang, but its obvious utility soon brought it into good usage. In one of Jerome K. Jerome's books, ""Paul Kelver,"" there is the following dialogue:

""The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints, and all the rest of it. It's Tommy-rot!""
""I wish you wouldn't use slang.""
""Well, you know what I mean. What is the proper word? Give it to me.""
""I suppose you mean cant.""
""No, I don't. Cant is something that you don't believe in yourself. It's Tommy-rot; there isn't any other word.""
Nor was there any other word for hubbub and to dwindle in Shakespeare's time; he adopted and dignified them because they met genuine needs. Nor was there any other satisfactory word for graft when it came in, nor for rowdy, nor for boom, nor for joy-ride, nor for omnibus-bill, nor for slacker, nor for trust-buster. Such words often retain a humorous quality; they are used satirically and hence appear but seldom in wholly serious discourse. But they have standing in the language nevertheless, and only a prig would hesitate to use them as Saintsbury used the best of the bunch and joke-smith.

On the other hand, many an apt and ingenious neologism, by falling too quickly into the gaping maw of the proletariat, is spoiled forthwith. Once it becomes, in Oliver Wendell Holmes' phrase, ""a cheap generic term, a substitute for differentiated [Pg311] specific expressions,"" it quickly acquires such flatness that the fastidious flee it as a plague. One recalls many capital verb-phrases, thus ruined by unintelligent appreciation, e. g., to hand him a lemon, to freeze on to, to have the goods, to fall for it, and to get by. One recalls, too, some excellent substantives, e. g., dope and dub, and compounds, e. g., come-on and easy-mark, and verbs, e. g., to vamp. These are all quite as sound in structure as the great majority of our most familiar words, but their adoption by the ignorant and their endless use and misuse in all sorts of situations have left them tattered and obnoxious, and they will probably go the way, as Matthews says, of all the other ""temporary phrases which spring up, one scarcely knows how, and flourish unaccountably for a few months, and then disappear forever, leaving no sign."" Matthews is wrong in two particulars here. They do not arise by any mysterious parthenogenesis, but come from sources which, in many cases, may be determined. And they last, alas, a good deal more than a month. Shoo-fly afflicted the American people for at least two years, and ""I don't think"" and aber nit quite as long. Even ""good-night"" lasted a whole year.

A very large part of our current slang is propagated by the newspapers, and much of it is invented by newspaper writers. One needs but turn to the slang of baseball to find numerous examples. Such phrases as to clout the sphere, the initial sack, to slam the pill and the dexter meadow are obviously not of bleachers manufacture. There is not enough imagination in that depressing army to devise such things; more often than not, there is not even enough intelligence to comprehend them. The true place of their origin is the perch of the newspaper reporters, whose competence and compensation is largely estimated, at least on papers of wide circulation, by their capacity for inventing novelties. The supply is so large that connoisseurship has grown up; an extra-fecund slang-maker on the press has his following. During the summer of 1913 the Chicago Record-Herald, somewhat alarmed by the extravagant fancy of its baseball reporters, asked its readers if they would prefer a return to plain English. Such of them as were literate enough [Pg312] to send in their votes were almost unanimously against a change. As one of them said, ""one is nearer the park when Schulte slams the pill than when he merely hits the ball."" In all other fields the newspapers originate and propagate slang, particularly in politics. Most of our political slang-terms since the Civil War, from pork-barrel to steam-roller, have been their inventions. The English newspapers, with the exception of a few anomalies such as the Pink-Un, lean in the other direction; their fault is not slanginess, but an otiose ponderosity—in Dean Alford's words, ""the insisting on calling common things by uncommon names; changing our ordinary short Saxon nouns and verbs for long words derived from the Latin.""[15] The American newspapers, years ago, passed through such a stage of bombast, but since the invention of yellow journalism by the elder James Gordon Bennett—that is, the invention of journalism for the frankly ignorant and vulgar—they have gone to the other extreme. Edmund Clarence Stedman noted the change soon after the Civil War. ""The whole country,"" he wrote to Bayard Taylor in 1873, ""owing to the contagion of our newspaper 'exchange' system, is flooded, deluged, swamped beneath a muddy tide of slang.""[16] A thousand alarmed watchmen have sought to stay it since, but in vain. The great majority of our newspapers, including all those of large circulation, are chiefly written, as one observer says, ""not in English, but in a strange jargon of words that would have made Addison or Milton shudder in despair.""[17]

The Future of the Language—The great Jakob Grimm, the founder of comparative philology, hazarded the guess more than three-quarters of a century ago that English would one day become [Pg313] the chief language of the world, and perhaps crowd out several of the then principal idioms altogether. ""In wealth, wisdom and strict economy,"" he said, ""none of the other living languages can vie with it."" At that time the guess was bold, for English was still in fifth place, with not only French and German ahead of it, but also Spanish and Russian. In 1801, according to Michael George Mulhall, the relative standing of the five, in the number of persons using them, was as follows:
French	31,450,000
Russian	30,770,000
German	30,320,000
Spanish	26,190,000
English	20,520,000
The population of the United States was then but little more than 5,000,000, but in twenty years it had nearly doubled, and thereafter it increased steadily and enormously, and by 1860 it was greater than that of the United Kingdom. Since that time the majority of English-speaking persons in the world have lived on this side of the water; today there are nearly three times as many as in the United Kingdom and nearly twice as many as in the whole British Empire. This great increase in the American population, beginning with the great immigrations of the 30's and 40's, quickly lifted English to fourth place among the languages, and then to third, to second and to first. When it took the lead the attention of philologists was actively directed to the matter, and in 1868 one of them, a German named Brackebusch, first seriously raised the question whether English was destined to obliterate certain of the older tongues.[18] Brackebusch decided against on various philological grounds, [Pg314] none of them sound. His own figures, as the following table from his dissertation shows,[19] were against him.

This in 1868. Before another generation had passed the lead of English, still because of the great growth of the United States, was yet more impressive, as the following figures for 1890 show.


Today the figures exceed even these. They show that English is now spoken by two and a half times as many persons as spoke it at the close of the American Civil War and by nearly eight times as many as spoke it at the beginning of the nineteenth century. No other language has spread in any such proportions. Even German, which is next on the list, shows but a four-fold gain since 1801, or just half that of English. The number of persons speaking Russian, despite the vast extension of the Russian empire during the last century of the czars, has little more than tripled, and the number speaking French has less than doubled. But here are the figures for 1911:


Japanese, perhaps, should follow French: it is spoken by 60,000,000 persons. But Chinese may be disregarded, for it is split into half a dozen mutually unintelligible dialects, and shows no sign of spreading beyond the limits of China. The same may be said of Hindustani, which is the language of 100,000,000 inhabitants of British India; it shows wide dialectical variations and the people who speak it are not likely to spread. But English is the possession of a race that is still pushing in all directions, and wherever that race settles the existing languages tend to succumb. Thus French, despite the passionate resistance of the French-Canadians, is gradually decaying in Canada; in all the newly-settled regions English is universal. And thus Spanish is dying out in our own Southwest, and promises to meet with severe competition in some of the nearer parts of Latin-America. The English control of the sea has likewise carried the language into far places. There is scarcely a merchant ship-captain on deep water, of whatever nationality, who does not find some acquaintance with it necessary, and it has become, in debased forms, the lingua franca of Oceanica and the Far East generally. ""Three-fourths of the world's mail matter,"" says E. H. Babbitt, ""is now addressed in English,"" and ""more than half of the world's newspapers are printed in English.""

Brackebusch, in the speculative paper just mentioned, came to the conclusion that the future domination of English would be prevented by its unphonetic spelling, its grammatical decay and the general difficulties that a foreigner encounters in seeking to master it. ""The simplification of its grammar,"" he said, ""is the commencement of dissolution, the beginning of the end, and its extraordinary tendency to degenerate into slang of [Pg316] every kind is the foreshadowing of its approaching dismemberment."" But in the same breath he was forced to admit that ""the greater development it has obtained"" was the result of this very simplification of grammar, and an inspection of the rest of his reasoning quickly shows its unsoundness, even without an appeal to the plain facts. The spelling of a language, whether it be phonetic or not, has little to do with its spread. Very few men learn it by studying books; they learn it by hearing it spoken. As for grammatical decay, it is not a sign of dissolution, but a sign of active life and constantly renewed strength. To the professional philologist, perhaps, it may sometimes appear otherwise. He is apt to estimate languages by looking at their complexity; the Greek aorist elicits his admiration because it presents enormous difficulties and is inordinately subtle. But the object of language is not to bemuse grammarians, but to convey ideas, and the more simply it accomplishes that object the more effectively it meets the needs of an energetic and practical people and the larger its inherent vitality. The history of every language of Europe, since the earliest days of which we have record, is a history of simplifications. Even such languages as German, which still cling to a great many exasperating inflections, including the absurd inflection of the article for gender, are less highly inflected than they used to be, and are proceeding slowly but surely toward analysis. The fact that English has gone further along that road than any other civilized tongue is not a proof of its decrepitude, but a proof of its continued strength. Brought into free competition with another language, say German or French or Spanish, it is almost certain to prevail, if only because it is vastly easier—that is, as a spoken language—to learn. The foreigner essaying it, indeed, finds his chief difficulty, not in mastering its forms, but in grasping its lack of forms. He doesn't have to learn a new and complex grammar; what he has to do is to forget grammar.

Once he has done so, the rest is a mere matter of acquiring a vocabulary. He can make himself understood, given a few nouns, pronouns, verbs and numerals, without troubling [Pg317] himself in the slightest about accidence. ""Me see she"" is bad English, perhaps, but it would be absurd to say that it is obscure—and on some not too distant tomorrow it may be very fair American. Essaying an inflected language, the beginner must go into the matter far more deeply before he may hope to be understood. Bradley, in ""The Making of English,""[23] shows clearly how German and English differ in this respect, and how great is the advantage of English. In the latter the verb sing has but eight forms, and of these three are entirely obsolete, one is obsolescent, and two more may be dropped out without damage to comprehension. In German the corresponding verb, singen, has no less than sixteen forms. How far English has proceeded toward the complete obliteration of inflections is shown by such barbarous forms of it as Pigeon English and Beach-la-Mar, in which the final step is taken without appreciable loss of clarity. The Pigeon English verb is identical in all tenses. Go stands for both went and gone; makee is both make and made. In the same way there is no declension of the pronoun for case. My is thus I, me, mine and our own my. ""No belong my"" is ""it is not mine""—a crude construction, of course, but still clearly intelligible. Chinamen learn Pigeon English in a few months, and savages in the South Seas master Beach-la-Mar almost as quickly. And a white man, once he has accustomed himself to either, finds it strangely fluent and expressive. He cannot argue politics in it, nor dispute upon transubstantiation, but for all the business of every day it is perfectly satisfactory.

As we have seen in Chapters V and VI, the American dialect of English has gone further along the road thus opened ahead than the mother dialect, and is moving faster. For this reason, and because of the fact that it is already spoken by a far larger and more rapidly multiplying body of people than the latter, it seems to me very likely that it will determine the final form of the language. For the old control of English over American to be reasserted is now quite unthinkable; if the two dialects are not to drift apart entirely English must follow in American's tracks. This yielding seems to have begun; the exchanges from [Pg318] American into English grow steadily larger and more important than the exchanges from English into American. John Richard Green, the historian, discerning the inevitable half a century ago, expressed the opinion, amazing and unpalatable then, that the Americans were already ""the main branch of the English people."" It is not yet wholly true; a cultural timorousness yet shows itself; there is still a class which looks to England as the Romans long looked to Greece. But it is not the class that is shaping the national language, and it is not the class that is carrying it beyond the national borders. The Americanisms that flood the English of Canada are not borrowed from the dialects of New England Loyalists and fashionable New Yorkers, but from the common speech that has its sources in the native and immigrant proletariat and that displays its gaudiest freightage in the newspapers.

The impact of this flood is naturally most apparent in Canada, whose geographical proximity and common interests completely obliterate the effects of English political and social dominance. By an Order in Council, passed in 1890, the use of the redundant u in such words as honor and labor is official in Canada, but practically all the Canadian newspapers omit it. In the same way the American flat a has swept whole sections of the country, and American slang is everywhere used, and the American common speech prevails almost universally in the newer provinces. More remarkable is the influence that American has exerted upon the speech of Australia and upon the crude dialects of Oceanica and the Far East. One finds such obvious Americanisms as tomahawk, boss, bush, canoe, go finish (=to die) and pickaninny in Beach-la-Mar[24] and more of them in Pigeon English. And one observes a very large number of American words and phrases in the slang of Australia. The Australian common speech, in pronunciation and intonation, resembles Cockney English, and a great many Cockneyisms are in it, but despite the small number of Americans in the Antipodes [Pg319] it has adopted, of late, so many Americanisms that a Cockney visitor must often find it difficult. Among them are the verb and verb-phrases, to beef, to biff, to bluff, to boss, to break away, to chase one's self, to chew the rag, to chip in, to fade away, to get it in the neck, to back and fill, to plug along, to get sore, to turn down and to get wise; the substantives, dope, boss, fake, creek, knockout-drops and push (in the sense of crowd); the adjectives, hitched (in the sense of married) and tough (as before luck), and the adverbial phrases, for keeps and going strong.[25] Here, in direct competition with English locutions, and with all the advantages on the side of the latter, American is making steady progress.

""This American language,"" says a recent observer, ""seems to be much more of a pusher than the English. For instance, after eight years' occupancy of the Philippines it was spoken by 800,000, or 10 per cent, of the natives, while after an occupancy of 150 of India by the British, 3,000,000, or one per cent, of the natives speak English.""[26] I do vouch for the figures. They may be inaccurate, in detail, but they at least state what seems to be a fact. Behind that fact are phenomena which certainly deserve careful study, and, above all, study divested of unintelligent prejudice. The attempt to make American uniform with English has failed ingloriously; the neglect of its investigation is an evidence of snobbishness that is a folly of the same sort. It is useless to dismiss the growing peculiarities of the American vocabulary and of grammar and syntax in the common speech as vulgarisms beneath serious notice. Such vulgarisms have a way of intrenching themselves, and gathering dignity as they grow familiar. ""There are but few forms in use,"" says Lounsbury, ""which, judged by a standard previously existing, would not be regarded as gross barbarisms.""[27] Each language, in such matters, is a law unto itself, and each vigorous dialect, particularly if it be spoken by millions, is a [Pg320] law no less. ""It would be as wrong,"" says Sayce, ""to use thou for the nominative thee in the Somersetshire dialect as it is to say thee art instead of you are in the Queen's English."" All the American dialect needs, in the long run, to make even pedagogues acutely aware of it, is a poet of genius to venture into it, as Chaucer ventured into the despised English of his day, and Dante into the Tuscan dialect, and Luther, in his translation of the Bible, into peasant German. Walt Whitman made a half attempt and then drew back; Lowell, perhaps, also heard the call, but too soon. The Irish dialect of English, vastly less important than the American, has already had its interpreters—Douglas Hyde, John Milington Synge and Augusta Gregory—and with what extraordinary results we all know. Here we have writing that is still indubitably English, but English rid of its artificial restraints and broken to the less self-conscious grammar and syntax of a simple and untutored folk. Synge, in his preface to ""The Playboy of the Western World,""[28] tells us how he got his gypsy phrases ""through a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen."" There is no doubt, he goes on, that ""in the happy ages of literature striking and beautiful phrases were as ready to the story-teller's or the playwright's hand as the rich cloaks and dresses of his time. It is probable that when the Elizabethan dramatist took his ink-horn and sat down to his work he used many phrases that he had just heard, as he sat at dinner, from his mother or his children.""

The result, in the case of the neo-Celts, is a dialect that stands incomparably above the tight English of the grammarians—a dialect so naïf, so pliant, so expressive, and, adeptly managed, so beautiful that even purists have begun to succumb to it, and it promises to leave lasting marks upon English style. The American dialect has not yet come to that stage. In so far as it is apprehended at all it is only in the sense that Irish-English was apprehended a generation ago—that is, as something [Pg321] uncouth and comic. But that is the way that new dialects always come in—through a drum-fire of cackles. Given the poet, there may suddenly come a day when our theirns and would'a hads will take on the barbaric stateliness of the peasant locutions of old Maurya in ""Riders to the Sea."" They seem grotesque and absurd today because the folks who use them seem grotesque and absurd. But that is a too facile logic and under it is a false assumption. In all human beings, if only understanding be brought to the business, dignity will be found, and that dignity cannot fail to reveal itself, soon or late, in the words and phrases with which they make known their high hopes and aspirations and cry out against the intolerable meaninglessness of life."
167,Black Boy,"Wright, Richard",b178_BlackBoy.txt,6,"That night in my rented room, while letting the hot water run over my can of pork and beans in the sink, I opened
A Book of Prefaces and began to read. I was jarred and shocked by the style, the clear, clean, sweeping sentences.
Why did he write like that? And how did one write like that? I pictured the man as a raging demon, slashing with his
pen, consumed with hate, denouncing everything American, extolling everything European or German, laughing at
the weakness of people, mocking God, authority. What was this? I stood up, trying to realize what reality lay behind
the meaning of the words…Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using
them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for here they were. Then maybe, perhaps, I could
use them as a weapon? No. It frightened me. I read on and what amazed me was not what he said, but how on earth
anybody had the courage to say it.
Occasionally I glance up to reassure myself that I was alone in the room. Who were these men about whom Mencken
was talking so passionately? Who was Anatole France? Joseph Conrad? Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, Dostoevski, George Moore, Gustave Flaubert, Maupassant, Tolstoy, Frank Harris, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy, Arnold Bennett, Stephen Crane, Zola, Norris, Gorky, Bergson, Ibsen, Balzac, Bernard Shaw, Dumas, Poe, Thomas Mann, O. Henry,
Dreiser, H.G. Wells, Gogol, T.S. Eliot, Gide, Baudelaire, Edgar Lee masters, Stendhal, Turgenev, Huneker, Nietzsche, and
scores of others? Were these men real? Did they exist or had they existed? And how did one pronounce their names?"
168,“Politics and the English Language.”,"Orwell, George",b179_PoliticsandtheEnglishLanguage.txt,6,"MOST PEOPLE WHO BOTHER with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way,
but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent,
and our language--so the argument runs--must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any
struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or
hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and
not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.
 Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have political and economic causes: it is not due
simply to the bad influence of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the
original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to
drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather
the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are
foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the
process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation
and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can
think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step towards political regeneration: so that the fight
against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers. I will come back to
this presently, and I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have become clearer.
Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English language as it is now habitually written.
 These five passages have not been picked out because they are especially bad--I could have quoted far worse
if I had chosen--but because they illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer. They are a
little below the average, but are fairly representative samples. I number them so that I can refer back to them
when necessary:
 I am not, indeed, sure whether it is not true to say that the Milton who once seemed not unlike a
seventeenth-century Shelley had not become, out of an experience ever more bitter in each year, more alien (sic)

 PROFESSOR HAROLD LASKI (Essay in Freedom of Expression)
 Above all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes such
egregious collocations of vocables as the Basic put up with for tolerate or put at a loss for bewilder.
 PROFESSOR LANCELOT HOGBEN (Interglossa)
 On the one side we have the free personality; by definition it is not neurotic, for it has neither conflict nor
dream. Its desires, such as they are, are transparent, for they are just what institutional approval keeps in the
forefront of consciousness; another institutional pattern would alter their number and intensity; there is little in
them that is natural, irreducible, or culturally dangerous. But on the other side, the social bond itself is nothing but
the mutual reflection of these self-secure integrities. Recall the definition of love. Is not this the very picture of a
small academic? Where is there a place in this hall of mirrors for either personality or fraternity?
 ESSAY ON PSYCHOLOGY in Politics (New York)
 All the ""best people"" from the gentlemen's clubs, and all the frantic fascist captains, united in common
hatred of Socialism and bestial horror of the rising tide of the mass revolutionary movement, have turned to acts
of provocation, to foul incendiarism, to medieval legends of poisoned wells, to legalize their own destruction of
proletarian organizations, and rouse the agitated petty-bourgeoisie to chauvinistic fervor on behalf of the fight
against the revolutionary way out of the crisis.
 COMMUNIST PAMPHLET
 If a new spirit is to be infused into this old country, there is one thorny and contentious reform which must
be tackled, and that is the humanization and galvanization of the B.B.C. Timidity here will bespeak canker and
atrophy of the soul. The heart of Britain may lee sound and of strong beat, for instance, but the British lion's roar
at present is like that of Bottom in Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream--as gentle as any sucking dove. A
virile new Britain cannot continue indefinitely to be traduced in the eyes, or rather ears, of the world by the effete languors of Langham Place, brazenly masquerading as ""standard English."" When the Voice of Britain is heard at
nine o'clock, better far and infinitely less ludicrous to hear aitches honestly dropped than the present priggish,
inflated, inhibited, school-ma'am-ish arch braying of blameless bashful mewing maidens.
 LETTER IN Tribune
 Each of these passages has faults of its own, but quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are
common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a
meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether
his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked
characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics
are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not
hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of
phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house. I list below, with notes and examples,
various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose-construction is habitually dodged:
 Dying metaphors. A newly-invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other
hand a metaphor which is technically ""dead"" (e.g., iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary
word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump
of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the
trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: Ring the changes on, take up the cudgels for, toe the
line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, an axe to grind, grist to the mill,
fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles' heel, swan song, hotbed. Many of these are used
without knowledge of their meaning (what is a ""rift,"" for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently
mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now current have been
twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe
the line is sometimes written tow the line. Another example is the hammer and the anvil, now always used with
the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never
the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would be aware of this, and would avoid
perverting the original phrase.
 Operators, or verbal false limbs. These save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the
same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases
are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give
grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to,
serve the purpose of, etc., etc. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, such
as break, stop, spoil, mend, kill, a verb becomes a phrase, made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some
general-purposes verb as prove, serve, form, play, render. In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used
in preference to the active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (by examination of instead of by
examining). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of the -ize and de- formations, and banal
statements are given an appearance of profundity by means of the not un- formation. Simple conjunctions and
prepositions are replaced by such phrases as with respect to, having regard to, the fact that, by dint of, in view of,
in the interests of, on the hypothesis that; and the ends of sentences are saved from anti-climax by such
resounding commonplaces as greatly to be desired, cannot be left out of account, a development to be expected in
the near future, deserving of serious consideration, brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and so on and so forth.
 Pretentious diction. Words like phenomenon, element, individual (as noun), objective, categorical, effective,
virtual, basis, primary, promote, constitute, exhibit, exploit, utilize, eliminate, liquidate, are used to dress up
simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments. Adjectives like epoch-making,
epic, historic, unforgettable, triumphant, age-old, inevitable, inexorable, veritable, are used to dignify the sordid
processes of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic color, its
characteristic words being: realm, throne, chariot, mailed fist, trident, sword, shield, buckler, banner, jackboot,
clarion. Foreign words and expressions such as cul de sac, ancien regime, deus ex machina, mutatis mutandis,
status quo, gleichschaltung, weltanschauung, are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Except for the useful
abbreviations i.e., e.g., and etc., there is no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in
English. Bad writers, and especially scientific, political and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the
notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate,
predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, subaqueous and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from
their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers.
 The jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (hyena, hangman, cannibal, petty bourgeois, these gentry, lackey,
flunkey, mad dog, White Guard, etc.) consists largely of words and phrases translated from Russian, German or
French; but the normal way of coining a new word is to use a Latin or Greek root with the appropriate affix and,
where necessary, the -ize formation. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (de-regionalize,
impermissible, extramarital, non-fragmentary and so forth) than to think up the English words that will cover
one's meaning. The result, in general, is an increase in slovenliness and vagueness.
 An interesting illustration of this is the way in which the English flower names which were in use till very
recently are being ousted by Greek ones, snap-dragon becoming antirrhinum, forget-me-not becoming myosotis,
etc. It is hard to see any practical reason for this change of fashion: it is probably due to an instinctive
turning-away from the more homely word and a vague feeling that the Greek word is scientific.
 Meaningless words. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal
to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Words like romantic, plastic,
values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense
that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader.
When one critic writes, ""The outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality,"" while another writes, ""The
immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar deadness, the reader accepts this as a simple
difference of opinion If words like black and white were involved, instead of the jargon words dead and living, he
would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused.
The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies ""something not desirable."" The words
democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which
cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed
definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a
country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of rÃ©gime claim that it is a
democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words
of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private
definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like Marshal PÃ©tain was a
true patriot, The Soviet Press is the freest in the world, The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution, are almost
always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less
dishonestly, are: class, totalitarian, science, progressive, reactionary bourgeois, equality.
 Example: ""Comfort's catholicity of perception and image, strangely Whitmanesque in range, almost the exact
opposite in aesthetic compulsion, continues to evoke that trembling atmospheric accumulative hinting at a cruel,
an inexorably serene timelessness . . . Wrey Gardiner scores by aiming at simple bullseyes with precision. Only
they are not so simple, and through this contented sadness runs more than the surface bittersweet of resignation.""
(Poetry Quarterly.)
 Now that I have made this catalogue of swindles and perversions, let me give another example of the kind of
writing that they lead to. This time it must of its nature be an imaginary one. I am going to translate a passage of
good English into modern English of the worst sort. Here is a well-known verse from Ecclesiastes:
 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread
to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth
to them all.
 Here it is in modern English:
 Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in
competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable
element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.
 This is a parody, but not a very gross one. Exhibit (3), above, for instance, contains several patches of the
same kind of English. It will be seen that I have not made a full translation. The beginning and ending of the
sentence follow the original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations--race, battle,
bread--dissolve into the vague phrase ""success or failure in competitive activities."" This had to be so, because no
modern writer of the kind I am discussing--no one capable of using phrases like objective consideration of
contemporary phenomena""--would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise and detailed way. The whole
tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness. Now analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The
first contains 49 words but only 60 syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life. The second contains 38
words of 90 syllables: 18 of its words are from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six
vivid images, and only one phrase (""time and chance"") that could be called vague. The second contains not a
single fresh, arresting phrase, and in spite of its 90 syllables it gives only a shortened version of the meaning
contained in the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining ground in modern
English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of writing is not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will
occur here and there in the worst-written page. Still, if you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty of
human fortunes, we should probably come much nearer to my imaginary sentence than to the one from
Ecclesiastes.
 As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their
meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips
of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer
humbug. The attraction of this way of writing, is that it is easy. It is easier--even quicker, once you have the
habit--to say In my opinion it is a not unjustifiable assumption that than to say I think. If you use ready-made
phrases, you not only don't have to hunt about for words; you also don't have to bother with the rhythms of your
sentences, since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are
composing in a hurry--when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech--it is
natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like a consideration which we should do well to bear in
mind or a conclusion to which all of us would readily assent will save many a sentence from coming down with a
bump. By using stale metaphors, similes and idioms, you save much mental effort at the cost of leaving your
meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself. This is the significance of mixed metaphors. The sole
aim of a metaphor is to call up a visual image. When these images clash--as in The Fascist octopus has sung its
swan song, the jackboot is thrown into the melting pot--it can be taken as certain that the writer is not seeing a
mental image of the objects he is naming; in other words he is not really thinking. Look again at the examples I
gave at the beginning of this essay. Professor Laski (1) uses five negatives in 53 words. One of these is
superfluous, making nonsense of the whole passage, and in addition there is the slip alien for akin, making further
nonsense, and several avoidable pieces of clumsiness which increase the general vagueness. Professor Hogben (2)
plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write prescriptions, and, while disapproving of the
everyday phrase put up with, is unwilling to look egregious up in the dictionary and see what it means. (3), if one
takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply meaningless: probably one could work out its intended
meaning by reading the whole of the article in which it occurs. In (4), the writer knows more or less what he
wants to say, but an accumulation of stale phrases chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In (5), words and
meaning have almost parted company. People who write in this manner usually have a general emotional
meaning--they dislike one thing and want to express solidarity with another--but they are not interested in the
detail of what they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four
questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer?
Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more
shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can
shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will
construct your sentences for you--even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent-and at need they will
perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the
special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear.
 In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing. Where it is not true, it will generally be found
that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a ""party line."" Orthodoxy, of
whatever color, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets,
leading articles, manifestoes, White Papers and the speeches of under-secretaries do, of course, vary from party
to party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech.
When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases--bestial
atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder--one often has a
curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly
becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank discs
which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of
phraseology has gone some distance towards turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming
out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the
speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of
what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if
not indispensable, is at any rate favorable to political conformity.
 In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the
continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on
Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do
not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of
euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the
inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets:
this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no
more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned
for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is
called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling
up mental pictures of them. Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian
totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, ""I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by
doing so."" Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:
 While freely conceding that the Soviet rÃ©gime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be
inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an
unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called
upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement."
169,“Abraham Lincoln and the Self-Made Myth.”,"Hofstadter, Richard",b180_AbrahamLincolnandtheSelfMadeMyth.txt,6,"Lincoln was shaken by the presidency. Back in Springfield, politics had been a sort of exhilarating game; but in the White House, politics was power, and power was responsibility. Never before had Lincoln held executive office. In public life he had always been an insignificant legislator whose votes were cast in concert with others and whose decisions in themselves had neither finality nor importance. As President he might consult with others, but innumerable grave decisions were in the end his own, and with them came a burden of responsibility terrifying in its dimensions. Lincolns rage for personal success, his external and worldly ambition, was quieted when he entered the White House, and he was at last left alone to reckon with himself. To be confronted with the fruits of his victory only to find that it meant choosing between life and death for others was immensely sobering. That Lincoln should have shouldered the moral burden of the war was characteristic of the high seriousness into which he had grown since 1854; and it may be true, as Professor Charles W. Ramsdell suggested, that he was stricken by an awareness of his own part in whipping up the crisis. This would go far to explain the desperation with which he issued pardons and the charity that he wanted to extend to the conquered South at the wars close. In one of his rare moments of self-revelation he is reported to have said: Now I dont know what the soul is, but whatever it is, I know that it can humble itself. The great prose of the presidential years came from a soul that had been humbled. Lincolns utter lack of personal malice during these years, his humane detachment, his tragic sense of life, have no parallel in political history."
170,“Mother Tongue.”,"Tan, Amy",b181_MotherTongue.txt,6,"Just last week, I was walking down the street with my mother, and I again found myself conscious of the English I was using, the English I do use with her. We were talking about the price of new and used furniture and I heard myself saying this: Not waste money that way. My husband was with us as well, and he didnt notice any switch in my English. And then I realized why. Its because over the twenty years weve been together Ive often used that same kind of English with him, and sometimes he even uses it with me. It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to family talk, the language I grew up with. So youll have some idea of what this family talk I heard sounds like, Ill quote what my mother said during a recent conversation which I videotaped and then transcribed. During this conversation, my mother was talking about a political gangster in Shanghai who had the same last name as her familys, Du, and how the gangster in his early years wanted to be adopted by her family, which was rich by comparison. Later, the gangster became more powerful, far richer than my mothers family, and one day showed up at my mothers wedding to pay his respects. Heres what she said in part: Du Yusong having business like fruit stand. Like off the street kind. He is Du like Du Zongbut not Tsung-ming Island people. The local people call putong, the river east side, he belong to that side local people. That man want to ask Du Zong father take him in like become own family. Du Zong father wasnt look down on him, but didnt take seriously, until that man big like become a mafia. Now important person, very hard to inviting him. Chinese way, came only to show respect, dont stay for dinner. Respect for making big celebration, he shows up. Mean gives lots of respect. Chinese custom. Chinese social life that way. If too important wont have to stay too long. He come to my wedding. I didnt see, I heard it. I gone to boys side, they have YMCA dinner. Chinese age I was nineteen."
171,“Take the Tortillas Out of Your Poetry.”,"Anaya, Rudolfo",b182_TaketheTortillasOutofYourPoetry.txt,6,"In a recent lecture, “Is Nothing Sacred?”, Salman Rushdie, one of the most censored authors of our time, talked about the importance of books. He grew up in a household in India where books were as sacred as bread. If anyone in the household dropped a piece of bread or a book, the person not only picked it up, but also kissed the object by way of apologizing for clumsy disrespect. He goes on to say that he had kissed many books before he had kissed a girl. Bread and books were for his household, and for many like his, food for the body and the soul. This image of the kissing of the book one had accidentally dropped made an impression on me. It speaks to the love and respect many people have for them. I grew up in a small town in New Mexico, and we had very few books in our household. The first one I remember reading was my catechism book. Before I went to school to learn English, my mother taught me catechism in Spanish. I remember the questions and answers I had to learn, and I remember the well-thumbed, frayed volume which was sacred to me. Growing up with few books in the house created in me a desire and a need for them. When I started school, I remember visiting the one room library of our town and standing in front of the dusty shelves. "
172,Democracy in America,"Tocqueville, Alexis de",b183_DemocracyinAmerica.txt,6,"The remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of Anglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the result (and this should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct elements), which in other places have been in frequent hostility, but which in America have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another. I allude to the spirit of Religion and the spirit of Liberty. The settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians and daring innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious opinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence arose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are constantly discernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country. It might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their family, and their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed in the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at so dear a rate. The energy, however, with which they strove for the acquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as liberties of the world, is scarcely inferior to that with which they devoted themselves to Heaven. Political principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded and altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which they were born were broken down before them; the old principles which had governed the world for ages were no more; a path without a turn and a field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent curiosity of man: but at the limits of the political world he checks his researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable faculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully abstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with submissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in the moral world everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in the political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed: in the one is a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an independence scornful of experience and jealous of authority. These two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from conflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other. Religion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the faculties of man, and that the political world is a field prepared by the Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the freedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the place which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely established than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by aught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy, and the divine source of its claims. The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom.on, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of freedom."

of nature and of natures God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes that impel them to such a course.
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure
these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any
form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance
to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will
dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such
government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the women
under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which
they are entitled. The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward
woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted
to a candid world.

He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.
He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.
He has withheld from her rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded menboth natives and foreigners.
Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in
the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.
He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.
He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.
He has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be
done in the presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise obedience to her
husband, he becoming, to all intents and purposes, her masterthe law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty,
and to administer chastisement.
He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes, and in case of separation, to whom the
guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of womenthe law, in all
cases, going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of man, and giving all power into his hands.
After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single, and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support
a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.
He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and from those she is permitted to follow, she receives
but a scanty remuneration. He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction which he considers most
honorable to himself. As a teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.
He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education, all colleges being closed against her.
He allows her in church, as well as state, but a subordinate position, claiming apostolic authority for her exclusion
from the ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public participation in the affairs of the church.
He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women, by
which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society are not only tolerated, but deemed of little account in
man.
He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when
that belongs to her conscience and to her God.
He has endeavored, in every way that he could, to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.
Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradationin view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and
fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and
privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United States."
174,"“What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?: An Address Delivered in Rochester, New York, on 5 July 1852.”","Douglass, Frederick",b185_WhattotheSlaveIstheFourthofJulyAnAddressDeliveredinRochesterNewYorkonJuly.txt,6,"Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men, too great enough to give frame to a great age. It does not often happen
to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them
is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They
were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with
you to honor their memory....
...Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I
represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice,
embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble
offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from
your independence to us?
Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nations 
sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully
acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs
of a nations jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that,
the dumb might eloquently speak, and the lame man leap as an hart.
But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the
pale of glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The
blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity
and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and
healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must
mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous
anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak
to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a
nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in
irrevocable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! We wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon
the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who
wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lords song in a strange
land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth.
Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and
grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do
not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, may my right hand forget her cunning, and may
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth! To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the
popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the
world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, is American slavery. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from
the slaves point of view. Standing there identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not
hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on
this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of
the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds
herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the
name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the
Bible which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can
command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery the great sin and shame of America! I will not equivocate; I
will not excuse; I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man,
whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.
But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, It is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists
fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, an denounce less; would you persuade
more, and rebuke less; your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is
nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject
do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded
already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in
the State of Virginia which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the
acknowledgment that the slave is a moral, intellectual, and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded.
It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and
penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws in reference to the beasts
of the field, then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of
the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish
the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!
For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are
ploughing, planting, and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building
ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and ciphering, acting
as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and
teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California,
capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning,
living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christians God, and
looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!
Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? That he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have
already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by
the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the

principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and
subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? Speaking of it relatively and positively,
negatively and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding. There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.
What, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to
keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to
load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their
teeth, to burn their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system
thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employment for my time
and strength than such arguments would imply.
What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of
divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason
on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is passed.
At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! Had I the ability, and could reach the
nations ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern
rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the
whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be
roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes
against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.
What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the
year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your
boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and
heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery;
your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him,
mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy  a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a
nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people
of the United States, at this very hour.
Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the Old World, travel
through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the
everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy,
America reigns without a rival."
175,Edited by Daniel J. Boorstin,An American Primer,b186_EditedbyDanielJBoorstin.txt,6,"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention: I would be presumptuous, indeed, to
present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened if this
were a mere measuring of abilities; but this is not a contest between persons. The
humblest citizen in all the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause, is stronger
than all the hosts of error. I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the
cause of liberty--the cause of humanity. ....
Never before in the history of this country has there been witnessed such a contest as that
through which we have just passed. Never before in the history of American politics has a
great issue been fought out as this issue has been, by the voters of a great party. ....
With a zeal approaching the zeal which inspired the crusaders who followed Peter the
hermit, our silver Democrats went forth from victory unto victory until they are now
assembled, not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by
the plain people of this country. In this contest brother has been arrayed against brother,
father against son. the warmest ties of love, acquaintance and association have been
disregarded; old leaders have been cast aside when they have refused to give expression
to the sentiments of those whom they would lead, and new leaders have sprung up to give
direction to the cause of truth. Thus has the contest been waged, and we have assembled
here under as binding and solemn instructions as were ever imposed upon representatives
of the people. ....
The gentleman who preceded me (ex-Governor Russell) spoke of the State of
Massachusetts; let me assure him that not one present in all this convention entertains the
least hostility to the people of the State of Massachusetts, but we stand here representing
people who are the equals, before the law, of the greatest citizens in the State of
Massachusetts. When you [turning to the gold delegates] come before us and tell us that
we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our
business interests by your course.
We say to you that you have made the definition of a business man too limited in its
application. The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his
employer; the attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation
counsel in a great metropolis; the merchant at the cross-roads store is as much a business
man as the merchant of New York; the farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all
day--who begins in the spring and toils all summerand who by the application of brain
and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth, is as much a business
man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price of grain; the
miners who go down a thousand feet into the earth, or climb two thousand feet upon the
cliffs, and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals to be poured into the
channels of trade are as much business men as the few financial magnates who, in a back
room, corner the money of the world. We come to speak for this broader class of business
men.
Ah, my friends, we say not one word against those who live upon the Atlantic coast, but
the hardy pioneers who have braved all the dangers of the wilderness, who have made the
desert to blossom as the rose--the pioneers away out there [pointing to the West], who
rear their children near to Nature's heart, where they can mingle their voices with the
voices of the birds--out there where they have erected schoolhouses for the education of
their young, churches where they praise their Creator, and cemeteries where rest the
ashes of their dead--these people, we say, are as deserving of the consideration of our
party as any people in this country. It is for these that we speak. We do not come as
aggressors. Our war is not a war of conquest; we are fighting in the defense of our homes,
our families, and posterity. We have petitioned, and our petitions have been scorned; we
have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded; we have begged, and they have
mocked when our calamity came. We beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no
more. We defy them.
The gentleman from Wisconsin [Senator Vilas] has said that he fears a Robespierre. My
friends, in this land of the free you need not fear that a tyrant will spring up from among
the people. What we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand, as Jackson stood, against the
encroachments of organized wealth.
They tell us that this platform was made to catch votes. We reply to them that changing
conditions make new issues; that the principles upon which Democracy rests are as
everlasting as the hills, but that they must be applied to new conditions as they arise.
Conditions have arisen, and we are here to meet those conditions. They tell us that the
income tax ought not to be brought in here; that it is a new idea. They criticize us for our
criticism of the Supreme Court of the United States. My friends, we have not criticized;
we have simply called attention to what you already know. If you want criticisms, read
the dissenting opinions of the court. There you will find criticisms. They say that we
passed an unconstitutional law; we deny it. The income tax law was not unconstitutional
when it was passed; it was not unconstitutional when it went before the Supreme Court
for the first time; it did not become unconstitutional until one of the judges changed his
mind, and we cannot be expected to know when a judge will change his mind. The
income tax is just. It simply intends to put the burdens of government justly upon the
backs of the people. I am in favor of an income tax. When I find a man who is not willing
to bear his share of the burdens of the government which protects him, I find a man who
is unworthy to enjoy the blessings of a government like ours.
They say that we are opposing national bank currency; it is true. If you will read what
Thomas Benton said, you will find he said that, in searching history, he could find but
one parallel to Andrew Jackson; that was Cicero, who destroyed the conspiracy of
Cataline and saved Rome. Benton said that Cicero only did for Rome what Jackson did
for us when he destroyed the bank conspiracy and saved America. We say in our platform
that we believe that the right to coin and issue money is a function of government. We
believe it. We believe that it is a part of sovereignty, and can no more with safety be
delegated to private individuals than we could afford to delegate to private individuals the
power to make penal statutes or levy taxes. Mr. Jefferson, who was once regarded as
good Democratic authority, seems to have differed in opinion from the gentleman who
has addressed us on the part of the minority. Those who are opposed to this proposition
tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank, and that the Government
ought to go out of the banking business. I stand with Jefferson rather than with them, and
tell them, as he did, that the issue of money is a function of government, and that the
banks ought to go out of the governing business.
They complain about the plank which declares against life tenure in office. They have
tried to strain it to mean that which it does not mean. What we oppose by that plank is the
life tenure which is being built up in Washington, and which excludes from participation
in official benefits the humbler members of society.
Let me call your attention to two or three important things. The gentleman from New
York says that he will propose an amendment to the platform providing that the proposed
change in our monetary system shall not affect contracts already made. Let me remind
you that there is no intention of affecting those contracts which according to present laws
are made payable in gold; but if he means to say that we cannot change our monetary
system without protecting those who have loaned money before the change was made, I
desire to ask him where, in law or in morals, he can find justification for not protecting
the debtors when the act of 1873 was passed, if he now insists that we must protect the
creditors.
He says he will also propose an amendment which will provide for the suspension of free
coinage if we fail to maintain the parity within a year. We reply that when we advocate a
policy which we believe will be successful, we are not compelled to raise a doubt as to
our own sincerity by suggesting what we shall do if we fail. I ask him, if he would apply
his logic to us, why he does not apply it to himself. He says he wants this country to try to
secure an international agreement. Why does he not tell us what he is going to do if he
fails to secure an international agreement? There is more reason for him to do that than
there is for us to provide against the failure to maintain the parity. Our opponents have
tried for twenty years to secure an international agreement, and those are waiting for it
most patiently who do not want it at all.
And now, my friends, let me come to the paramount issue. If they ask us why it is that we
say more on the money question than we say upon the tariff question, I reply that, if
protection has slain its thousands, the gold standard has slain its tens of thousands. If they
ask us why we do not embody in our platform all the things that we believe in, we reply
that when we have restored the money of the Constitution all other necessary reforms will
be possible; but that until this is done there is no other reform that can be accomplished.
Why is it that within three months such a change has come over the country? Three
months ago, when it was confidently asserted that those who believe in the gold standard
would frame our platform and nominate our candidates, even the advocates of the gold
standard did not think that we could elect a president. And they had good reason for their
doubt, because there is scarcely a State here today asking for the gold standard which is
not in the absolute control of the Republican party. But note the change. Mr. McKinley
was nominated at St. Louis upon a platform which declared for the maintenance of the
gold standard until it can be changed into bimetallism by international agreement. Mr.
McKinley was the most popular man among the Republicans, and three months ago
everybody in the Republican party prophesied his election. How is it today? Why, the
man who was once pleased to think that he looked like Napoleon--that man shudders
today when he remembers that he was nominated on the anniversary of the battle of
Waterloo. Not only that, but as he listens he can hear with ever-increasing distinctness the
sound of the waves as they beat upon the lonely shores of St. Helena.
Why this change? Ah, my friends, is not the reason for the change evident to any one
who will look at the matter? No private character, however pure, no personal popularity,
however great, can protect from the avenging wrath of an indignant people a man who
will declare that he is in favor of fastening the gold standard upon this country, or who is
willing to surrender the right of self-government and place the legislative control of our
affairs in the hands of foreign potentates and powers.
We go forth confident that we shall win. Why? Because upon the paramount issue of this
campaign there is not a spot of ground upon which the enemy will dare to challenge
battle. If they tell us that the gold standard is a good thing, we shall point to their platform
and tell them that their platform pledges the party to get rid of the gold standard and
substitute bimetallism. If the gold standard is a good thing, why try to get rid of it? I call
your attention to the fact that some of the very people who are in this convention today
and who tell us that we ought to declare in favor of international bimetallism--thereby
declaring that the gold standard is wrong and that the principle of bimetallism is better--
these very people four months ago were open and avowed advocates of the gold standard,
and were then telling us that we could not legislate two metals together, even with the aid
of all the world. If the gold standard is a good thing, we ought to declare in favor of its
retention and not in favor of abandoning it; and if the gold standard is a bad thing why
should we wait until other nations are willing to help us to let go? Here is the line of
battle, and we care not upon which issue they force the fight; we are prepared to meet
them on either issue or on both. If they tell us that the gold standard is the standard of
civilization, we reply to them that this, the most enlightened of all the nations of the
earth, has never declared for a gold standard and that both the great parties this year are
declaring against it. If the gold standard is the standard of civilization, why, my friends,
should we not have it? If they come to meet us on that issue we can present the history of
our nation. More than that; we can tell them that they will search the pages of history in
vain to find a single instance where the common people of any land have ever declared
themselves in favor of the gold standard. They can find where the holders of the fixed
investments have declared for a gold standard, but not where the masses have.
Mr. Carlisle said in 1878 that this was a struggle between ""the idle holders of idle capital""
and ""the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;""
and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic
party fight; upon the side of ""the idle holders of idle capital"" or upon the side of ""the
struggling masses?"" That is the question which the party must answer first, and then it
must be answered by each individual hereafter. The sympathies of the Democratic party,
as shown by the platform, are on the side of the struggling masses who have ever been
the foundation of the Democratic party. There are two ideas of government. There are
those who believe that, if you will only legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, their
prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea, however, has been that
if you legislate to make the masses prosperous, their prosperity will find its way up
through every class which rests upon them.
You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard; we reply
that the great cities rest upon our broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and
leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms
and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.
My friends, we declare that this nation is able to legislate for its own people on every
question, without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation on earth; and upon
that issue we expect to carry every State in the Union. I shall not slander the inhabitants
of the fair State of Massachusetts nor the inhabitants of the State of New York by saying
that, when they are confronted with the proposition, they will declare that this nation is
not able to attend to its own business. It is the issue of 1776 over again. Our ancestors,
when but three millions in number, had the courage to declare their political
independence of every other nation; shall we, their descendants, when we have grown to
seventy millions, declare that we are less independent than our forefathers? No, my
friends, that will never be the verdict of our people. Therefore, we care not upon what
lines the battle is fought. If they say bimetallism is good, but that we cannot have it until
other nations help us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard because England
has, we will restore bimetallism, and then let England have bimetallism because the
United States has it. If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold
standard as a good thing, we will fight them to the uttermost.
Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the
commercial interests, the laboring interests, and the toilers everywhere, we will answer
their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the
brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold."

architecture has been exceptionally complex, both in the multiple traditions from 
which it has drawn and in the variations of style and public response it has pro-

of its advocacy of black self-defense and racial separatism, Clay kept his affiliation 
with the group secret until February 1964, when he defeated Sonny Liston and be- 
came heavyweight champion. He then announced his religious ties and stated that 
he had rejected his “slave” name in favor of the new name Muhammad Ali. 
For a decade thereafter, Ali remained at the center of controversy. Many re- 
porters and boxing officials continued to refer to him as Cassius Clay and some 
even demanded that his title be withdrawn. The hostility increased when he refused 
in 1967 to be inducted into the army, citing the fact that his religion forbade him 
from doing so. Government officials were unwilling to accept his claim that he was 
a lay Islamic minister, especially when he made clear his lack of sympathy."
177,What They Fought For 1861–1865,"McPherson, James M",b188_WhatTheyFoughtFor.txt,6,"One of the questions often asked a Civil War historian is, Why did the North fight? Southern motives seem easier
to understand. Confederates fought for independence, for their own property and way of life, for their very survival
as a nation. But what did the Yankees fight for? Why did they persist through four years of the bloodiest conflict in
American history, costing 360,000 northern livesnot to mention 260,000 southern lives and untold destruction of
resources? Puzzling over this question in 1863, Confederate War Department clerk John Jones wrote in his diary: Our
men must prevail in combat, or lose their property, country, freedom, everything. On the other hand the enemy, in
yielding the contest, may retire into their own country, and possess everything they enjoyed before the war began.
If that was true, why did the Yankees keep fighting? We can find much of the answer in Abraham Lincolns notable
speeches: the Gettysburg Address, his first and second inaugural addresses, the peroration of his message to Congress on December 1, 1862. But we can find even more of the answer in the wartime letters and diaries of the men
who did the fighting. Confederates who said that they fought for the same goals as their forebears of 1776 would
have been surprised by the intense conviction of the northern soldiers that they were upholding the legacy of the
American Revolution.

The settling of America began with an idea. The idea was that the citizens of a soci- 
ety could join freely and agree to govern themselves by making laws for the com- 
mon good. 
 
On November 11, 1620, after sixty-six days at sea, the sailing ship Mayflower ap- 
proached land. On board were 102 passengers. Their destination was the area at 
the mouth of the Hudson River, but because of rough seas they missed their goal 
and anchored in what is now Provincetown Harbor off Cape Cod. Since it was late 
autumn, they decided to make their landing there rather than to sail on. And since 
they were no longer in the territory for which they had a patent, they signed a 
covenant before they landed in order to establish a basis for self-government by 
which all of them were bound. 
 
About a third of the passengers were members of an English separatist congre- 
gation that had earlier fled to Leyden, the Netherlands, in search of religious free- 
dom. The entire group of English colonists was later called the Pilgrims. The 
colonists had negotiated an agreement with the Virginia Company of London that 
gave them the right to locate wherever they chose in that companys vast holdings 
and to govern themselves. 
 
Forty-one of the male passengers signed the covenant aboard ship. In what was 
later known as the Mayflower Compact, the signers pledged to create a body politic that would be based on the consent of the governed and ruled by law. And they fur- 
ther agreed to submit to the laws framed by the new body politic. 
 
The compact was signed by every head of a family, every adult bachelor, and 
most of the hired manservants aboard the Mayflower. It was signed both by sepa- 
ratists and non-separatists. Women were not asked to sign, since they did not have 
political rights. 
 
On the day after Christmas, the 102 settlers disembarked at what is now Ply- 
mouth, Massachusetts. Those who had signed the compact became the governing 
body of the Plymouth colony, with the power to elect officers, pass laws, and admit 
new voting members. The covenant entered into on that November day on a ship 
at anchor in the wilderness harbor established the basis for self-government and 
the rule of law in the new land."
179,America’s Constitution: A Biography,"Amar, Akhil Reed",b190_AmericasConstitutionABiography.txt,6,"Lets begin with two tiny puzzles posed by the Article I command that Representatives and direct Taxes shall be
apportioned among the several Statesby adding to the whole Number of free Personsthree fifths of all other
Persons. First, although this language specified the apportionment formula among the several states, it failed to
specify the formula within each state.

A second small puzzle: why did Article I peg the number of representatives to the underlying number of persons,
instead of the underlying number of eligible voters, a l New York?

These two small problems, centering on the seemingly innocent words among and Persons quickly spiral out into
the most vicious words of the apportionment clause: adding three fifths of all other persons. Other persons here
meant other than free persons  that is, slaves. Thus, the more slaves a given states master class bred or bought, the
more seats the state could claim in Congress, for every decade in perpetuity.
The Philadelphia draftsmen camouflaged this ugly point as best they could, euphemistically avoiding the S-word and
simultaneously introducing the T-word  taxes  into the equation (Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned).

The full import of the camouflaged clause eluded many readers in the late 1780s. In the wake of two decades of
debate about taxation and burdens under the empire and confederation, many Founding-era Americans confronting
the clause focused on taxation rather than on representation. Some Northern critics grumbled that three-fifths should
have been five-fifths so as to oblige the South to pay more taxes, without noticing that five-fifths would have also
enabled the South to gain more House seats."
180,1776,"McCullough, David",b191_1776.txt,6,"On January 14, two weeks into the new year, George Washington wrote one of the most forlorn, despairing letters of
his life. He had been suffering sleepless nights in the big house by the Charles. The reflection upon my situation and
that of this army produces many an uneasy hour when all around me are wrapped in sleep, he told the absent Joseph
Reed. Few people know the predicament we are in.
Filling page after page, he enumerated the same troubles and woes he had been reporting persistently to Congress
for so long, and that he would report still again to John Hancock that same day. There was too little powder, still no
money. (Money was useful in the common affairs of life but in war it was essential, Washington would remind the
wealthy Hancock.) So many of the troops who had given up and gone home had, against orders, carried off muskets
that were not their own that the supply of arms was depleted to the point where there were not enough for the new
recruits. We have not at this time 100 guns in the stores of all that have been taken in the prize ship [the captured
British supply ship Nancy], he wrote to Reed. On paper his army numbered between 8,000 and 10,000. In reality
only half that number where fit for duty.
It was because he had been unable to attack Boston that things had come to such a pass, he was convinced, The
changing of one army to another in the midst of winter, with the enemy so close at hand, was like nothing, in the
pages of history. That the British were so blind to what was going on and the true state of his situation he considered nearly miraculous.
He was downcast and feeling quite sorry for himself. Had he known what he was getting into, he told Reed, he would
never have accepted the command."
181,Mirror of the World: A New History of Art,"Bell, Julian",b192_MirroroftheWorldANewHistoryofArt.txt,6,"The idea that artists are transforming the cultures around them and imagining the previously unimaginable  Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel, for instancemakes for a more exciting story. But if we insist on looking for
innovation, we may go against the historical grain. Art cultures always move, but not always in leaps. Westerners are
used to thinking that small-scale societies (Aboriginal Australia, for instance) have changed their terms of reference
relatively slowly, but the same might be said of the largest of all regional civilizations. Through the 16th centuryas 
through most of the last two millenniathe worlds wealthiest and most populous state was China, then ruled by the
Ming dynasty. Far from Beijing, the empires capital, a landed elite had converged for three centuries around the lakeside city of Souzhou. In this agreeably sophisticated environment, Weng Zhingming was one of hundreds devoting
himself to painting scrolls with landscape or plant studies accompanied by poetic inscriptions. It was a high-minded
pursuit, in so far as literati like Wen would not (in principle at least) take money for their work.
Wens Seven Junipers of 1532 stands out among the throng of such works on account of its whip-crack dynamism,
a wild, irregular rhythm bounding over the length of three and a half metres (twelve feet) of paper. It seems to do
things with pictorial space that Western painters would not attempt until the 20th century. But its forceunlike that
of contemporary works by Michelangelois by no means a matter of radicalism. Wen, painting the scroll in his sixties,
was returning to an image painted by his revered predecessor in Suzhou, Shen Zhou, and looking back beyond Shen
to the style of Zhao Mengfu, who had painted around 1300. His accompanying poem, written in admiration of antiquity, identifies the junipers as morally encouraging emblems of resilience as magic witnesses of days gone by. Who
knows, he adds wistfully, what is to come hereafter? In other words, the momentum here is one of nostalgia: in the
hands of a distinguished exponent in a privileged location in a politically unruffled era, backwards-looking might have
a creative force of its own. "
182,FedViews by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,MISSING,b193_FedViewsbytheFederalReserveBankofSanFrancisco.txt,6,"The opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of the management of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Mary C. Daly, vice president and director of the Center for the Study of Innovation and Productivity at the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, states her views on the current economy and the outlook.
Financial markets are improving, and the crisis mode that has characterized the past year is subsiding. The
adverse feedback loop, in which losses by banks and other lenders lead to tighter credit availability, which
then leads to lower spending by households and businesses, has begun to slow. As such, investors’ appetite for
risk is returning, and some of the barriers to credit that have been constraining businesses and households are
diminishing.
Income from the federal fiscal stimulus, as well as some improvement in confidence, has helped stabilize consumer spending. Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, this is a key factor
affecting our forecast of growth in the third quarter.
The gradual nature of the recovery will put additional pressure on state and local budgets. Following a difficult
2009, especially in the West, most states began the 2010 fiscal year on July 1 with even larger budget gaps to
solve.
Still, many remain worried that large fiscal deficits will eventually be inflationary. However, a look at the empirical link between fiscal deficits and inflation in the United States shows no correlation between the two. Indeed,
during the 1980s, when the United States was running large deficits, inflation was coming down."
183,Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences,"Paulos, John Allen",b194_InnumeracyMathematicalIlliteracyandItsConsequences.txt,6,"Introduction
""Math was always my worst subject.""
""A million dollars, a billion, a trillion, whatever. It doesn't matter as long as we do something
about the problem.""
""Jerry and I aren't going to Europe, what with all the terrorists.""
Innumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and
chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe
when words such as ""imply"" and ""infer"" are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to
even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a
party drone on about the difference between ""continually"" and ""continuously."" Later that
evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a
50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that
there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the
self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn't nearly as
indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle. In fact, unlike
other failings which are hidden, mathematical illiteracy is often flaunted: ""I can't even balance
my checkbook."" ""I'm a people person, not a numbers person."" Or ""I always hated math.""
Part of the reason for this perverse pride in mathematical ignorance is that its consequences
are not usually as obvious as are those of other weaknesses. Because of this, and because I
firmly believe that people respond better to illustrative particulars than they do to general
exposition, this book will examine many real-world examples of innumeracy— stock scams,
choice of a spouse, newspaper psychics, diet and medical claims, the risk of terrorism, astrology,
sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, psychoanalysis,
parapsychology, lotteries, and drug testing among them.
I've tried not to pontificate excessively or to make too many sweeping generalizations about
popular culture or our educational system (a la Allan Bloom), but I have made a number of
general remarks and observations that I hope are supported by the examples. In my opinion,
some of the blocks to dealing comfortably with numbers and probabilities are due to quite natural
psychological responses to uncertainty, to coincidence, or to how a problem is framed. Others can
be attributed to anxiety, or to romantic misconceptions about the nature and importance of
mathematics.
One rarely discussed consequence of innumeracy is its link with belief in pseudoscience, and
the interrelationship between the two is here explored. In a society where genetic engineering,
laser technology, and microchip circuits are daily adding to our understanding of the world, it's
especially sad that a significant portion of our adult population still believes in Tarot cards,
channeling mediums, and crystal power.
Even more ominous is the gap between scientists' assessments of various risks and the
popular perceptions of those risks, a gap that threatens eventually to lead either to unfounded and
crippling anxieties or to impossible and economically paralyzing demands for risk-free guarantees.
Politicians are seldom a help in this regard since they deal with public opinion and are therefore
loath to clarify the likely hazards and trade-offs associated with almost any policy.
Because the book is largely concerned with various inadequacies—a lack of numerical
perspective, an exaggerated appreciation for meaningless coincidence, a credulous acceptance of
pseudosciences, an inability to recognize social trade-offs, and so on— much of the writing has a
debunking flavor to it. Nevertheless, I hope I've avoided the overly earnest and scolding tone
common to many such endeavors.
The approach throughout is gently mathematical, using some elementary ideas from
probability and statistics which, though deep in a sense, will require nothing more than
common sense and arithmetic. Some of the notions presented are rarely discussed in terms
accessible to a wide audience and are the kind of thing that my students, for example, often
enjoy but usually respond to with: ""Will we need to know that for the quiz?"" There won't be a
quiz, so they can be enjoyed freely, and the occasional difficult passage can be ignored with
impunity.
One contention of the book is that innumerate people characteristically have a strong
tendency to personalize—to be misled by their own experiences, or by the media's focus on
individuals and drama. From this it doesn't necessarily follow that mathematicians are
impersonal or formal. I'm not, and the book isn't either. My goal in writing it has been to
appeal to the educated but innumerate—at least to those whose fear of mathematics is not so
great that (num)(ber) is automatically read as (numb)(er). The book will have been well worth
the effort if it can begin to clarify just how much innumeracy pervades both our private and our
public lives.
1Examples and Principles
Two aristocrats are out horseback riding and one challenges the other to see which can come
up with the larger number. The second agrees to the contest, concentrates for a few minutes, and
proudly announces, ""Three."" The proposer of the game is quiet for half an hour, then finally
shrugs and concedes defeat.
A summer visitor enters a hardware store in Maine and buys a large number of expensive
items. The skeptical, reticent owner doesn't say a word as he adds the bill on the cash register.
When he's finished, he points to the total and watches as the man counts out $1,528.47. He then
methodically recounts the money once, twice, three times. The visitor finally asks if he's given
him the right amount of money, to which the Mainer grudgingly responds, ""Just barely.""
The mathematician G. H. Hardy was visiting his protege, the Indian mathematician
Ramanujan, in the hospital. To make small talk, he remarked that 1729, the number of the taxi
which had brought him, was a rather dull number, to which Ramanujan replied immediately, ""No,
Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum
of two cubes in two different ways.""
BIG NUMBERS, SMALL PROBABILITIES
People's facility with numbers ranges from the aristocratic to the Ramanujanian, but it's an
unfortunate fact that most are on the aristocrats' side of our old Mainer. I'm always amazed and
depressed when I encounter students who have no idea what the population of the United States
is, or the approximate distance from coast to coast, or roughly what percentage of the world is
Chinese. I sometimes ask them as an exercise to estimate how fast human hair grows in miles per
hour, or approximately how many people die on earth each day, or how many cigarettes are
smoked annually in this country. Despite some initial reluctance (one student maintained that
hair just doesn't grow in miles per hour), they often improve their feeling for numbers dramatically.
Without some appreciation of common large numbers, it's impossible to react with the proper
skepticism to terrifying reports that more than a million American kids are kidnapped each year,
or with the proper sobriety to a warhead carrying a megaton of explosive power—the equivalent of a
million tons (or two billion pounds) of TNT.
And if you don't have some feeling for probabilities, automobile accidents might seem a
relatively minor problem of local travel, whereas being killed by terrorists might seem to be a
major risk when going overseas. As often observed, however, the 45,000 people killed annually on
American roads are approximately equal in number to all American dead in the Vietnam War. On
the other hand, the seventeen Americans killed by terrorists in 1985 were among the 28 million of
us who traveled abroad that year—that's one chance in 1.6 million of becoming a victim. Compare
that with these annual rates in the United States: one chance in 68,000 of choking to death; one
chance in 75,000 of dying in a bicycle crash; one chance in 20,000 of drowning; and one chance in
only 5,300 of dying in a car crash.
Confronted with these large numbers and with the correspondingly small probabilities
associated with them, the innumerate will inevitably respond with the non sequitur, ""Yes, but
what if you're that one,"" and then nod knowingly, as if they've demolished your argument with
their penetrating insight. This tendency to personalize is, as we'll see, a characteristic of many
people who suffer from innumeracy. Equally typical is a tendency to equate the risk from some
obscure and exotic malady with the chances of suffering from heart and circulatory disease,
from which about 12,000 Americans die each week.
There's a joke I like that's marginally relevant. An old married couple in their nineties
contact a divorce lawyer, who pleads with them to stay together. ""Why get divorced now after
seventy years of marriage? Why not last it out? Why now?"" The little old lady finally pipes up
in a creaky voice: ""We wanted to wait until the children were dead.""
A feeling for what quantities or time spans are appropriate in various contexts is essential
to getting the joke. Slipping between millions and billions or between billions and trillions
should in this sense be equally funny, but it isn't, because we too often lack an intuitive feeling
for these numbers. Many educated people have little grasp for these numbers and are even
unaware that a million is 1,000,000; a billion is 1,000,000,000; and a trillion,
1,000,000,000,000.
A recent study by Drs. Kronlund and Phillips of the University of Washington showed
that most doctors' assessments of the risks of various operations, procedures, and medications
(even in their own specialties) were way off the mark, often by several orders of magnitude. I
once had a conversation with a doctor who, within approximately twenty minutes, stated that
a certain procedure he was contemplating (a) had a one-chance-in-a-million risk associated with
it; (6) was 99 percent safe; and (c) usually went quite well. Given the fact that so many doctors
seem to believe that there must be at least eleven people in the waiting room if they're to avoid
being idle, I'm not surprised at this new evidence of their innumeracy.
For very big or very small numbers, so-called scientific notation is often clearer and easier
to work with than standard notation and I'll therefore sometimes use it. There's nothing very
tricky about it.
It is not exactly commonplace, but numbers like ten thousand, one
million, and a trillion are. Examples of collections each having a million elements, a billion
elements, and so on, should be at hand for quick comparison. For example, knowing that it
takes only about eleven and a half days for a million seconds to tick away, whereas almost
thirty-two years are required for a billion seconds to pass, gives one a better grasp of the
relative magnitudes of these two common numbers. What about trillions? Modern Homo sapiens
is probably less than 10 trillion seconds old; and the subsequent complete disappearance of the
Neanderthal version of early Homo sapiens occurred only a trillion or so seconds ago.
Agriculture's been here for approximately 300 billion seconds (ten thousand years), writing for
about 150 billion seconds, and rock music has been around for only about one billion seconds.
More common sources of such large numbers are the trillion-dollar federal budget and our
burgeoning weapons stockpiles. Given a U.S. population of about 250 million people, every
billion dollars in the federal budget translates into $4 for every American. Thus, an annual
Defense Department budget of almost a third of a trillion dollars amounts to approximately
$5,000 per year for a family of four. What have all these expenditures (ours and theirs) bought
over the years? The TNT equivalent of all the nuclear weapons in the world amounts to 25,000
megatons, or 50 trillion pounds, or 10,000 pounds for every man, woman, and child on earth.
(One pound in a car, incidentally, demolishes the car and kills everyone in it.) The nuclear
weapons on board just one of our Trident submarines contain eight times the firepower
expended in all of World War II.
To cite some happier illustrations for smaller numbers, the standard I use for the lowly
thousand is a section of Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia which I know contains 1,008 seats
and which is easy to picture. The north wall of a garage near my house contains almost exactly
ten thousand narrow bricks. For one hundred thousand, I generally think of the number of
words in a good-sized novel.
To get a handle on big numbers, it's useful to come up with one or two collections such as
the above corresponding to each power of ten, up to maybe 13 or 14. The more personal you can
make these collections, the better. It's also good practice to estimate whatever quantity piques
your curiosity: How many pizzas are consumed each year in the United States? How many
words have you spoken in your life? How many different people's names appear in The New
York Times each year? How many watermelons would fit inside the U.S. Capitol building?
Compute roughly how many acts of sexual intercourse occur each day in the world. Does the
number vary much from day to day? Estimate the number of potential human beings, given all the
human ova and sperm there have ever been, and you find that the ones who make it to
actuality are ipso facto incredibly, improbably fortunate.
These estimations are generally quite easy and often suggestive. For example, what is the
volume of all the human blood in the world? The average adult male has about six quarts of
blood, adult women slightly less, children considerably less. Thus, if we estimate that on
average each of the approximately 5 billion people in the world has about one gallon of blood,
we get about 5 billion gallons of blood in the world. 
Central Park in New York has an area of 840 acres, or about 1.3 square miles. If walls
were built about it, all the blood in the world would cover the park to a depth of something under 20
feet. The Dead Sea on the Israel-Jordan border has an area of 390 square miles. If all the world's
blood were put into the Dead Sea, it would add only three-fourths of an inch to its depth. Even
without any particular context, these figures are surprising; there isn't that much blood in the
world! Compare this with the volume of all the grass, or of all the leaves, or of all the algae in the
world, and man's marginal status among life forms, at least volume-wise, is vividly apparent.
Switching dimensions for a moment, consider the ratio of the speed of the supersonic
Concorde, which travels about 2,000 miles per hour, to that of a snail, which moves 25 feet per
hour, a pace equivalent to about .005 miles per hour. The Concorde's velocity is 400,000 times that
of the snail. An even more impressive ratio is that between the speed with which an average
computer adds ten-digit numbers and the rate at which human calculators do so. Computers perform
this task more than a million times faster than we do with our snail-like scratchings, and for
supercomputers the ratio is over a billion to one.
One last earthly calculation that a scientific consultant from M.I.T. uses to weed out prospective
employees during job interviews: How long, he asks, would it take dump trucks to cart away an
isolated mountain, say Japan's Mount Fuji, to ground level? Assume trucks come every fifteen
minutes, twenty-four hours a day, are instantaneously filled with mountain dirt and rock, and
leave without getting in each other's way. The answer's a little surprising and will be given later.
GARGANTUAN NUMBERS AND THE FORBES 400
A concern with scale has been a mainstay of world literature from the Bible to Swift's
Lilliputians, from Paul Bunyan to Rabelais' Gargantua. Yet it's always struck me how
inconsistent these various authors have been in their use of large numbers.
The infant Gargantua (whence ""gargantuan"") is said to have needed 17,913 cows to supply him
with milk. As a young student he traveled to Paris on a mare that was as large as six elephants,
and hung the bells of Notre Dame on the mare's neck as jingles. Returning home, he was attacked
by cannon fire from a castle, and combed the cannonballs from his hair with a 900-foot-long rake.
For a salad he cut lettuces as large as walnut trees, and devoured half a dozen pilgrims who'd
hidden among the trees. Can you determine the internal inconsistencies of this story?
The book of Genesis says of the Flood that "". . . all the high hills that were under the whole
heaven were covered ..."" Taken literally, this seems to indicate that there were 10,000 to 20,000
feet of water on the surface of the earth, equivalent to more than half a billion cubic miles of liquid!
Since, according to biblical accounts, it rained for forty days and forty nights, or for only 960
hours, the rain must have fallen at a rate of at least fifteen feet per hour, certainly enough to sink
any aircraft carrier, much less an ark with thousands of animals on board.
Determining internal inconsistencies such as these is one of the minor pleasures of numeracy.
The point, however, is not that one should be perpetually analyzing numbers for their consistency
and plausibility, but that, when necessary, information can be gleaned from the barest numerical
facts, and claims can often be refuted on the basis of these raw numbers alone. If people were
more capable of estimation and simple calculation, many obvious inferences would be drawn (or
not), and fewer ridiculous notions would be entertained.
Before returning to Rabelais, let's consider two hanging wires of equal cross section. (This
latter sentence, I'm sure, has never before appeared in print.) The forces on the wires are
proportional to their masses, which are proportional to their lengths. Since the areas of the
cross sections of the supporting wires are equal, the stresses in the wire, force divided by
cross-sectional area, vary as the lengths of the wires. A wire ten times as long as another will
have ten times the stress of the shorter one. Similar arguments show that, of two geometrically
similar bridges of the same material, the larger one is necessarily the weaker of the two.
Likewise, a six-foot man cannot be scaled up to thirty feet, Rabelais notwithstanding.

There is a fundamental property of numbers named after the Greek mathematician
Archimedes which states that any number, no matter how huge, can be exceeded by adding
together sufficiently many of any smaller number, no matter how tiny. Though obvious in
principle, the consequences are sometimes resisted, as they were by the student of mine who
maintained that human hair just didn't grow in miles per hour. Unfortunately, the
nanoseconds used up in a simple computer operation do add up to lengthy bottlenecks on
intractable problems, many of which would require millennia to solve in general."
184,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,"Gladwell, Malcolm",b195_TheTippingPointHowLittleThingsCanMakeaBigDifference.txt,6,"The second distinguishing characteristic of these two examples is that in both cases little changes had big effects. All of the possible reasons for why New York's crime rate dropped are changes that happened at the margin; they were incremental changes. The crack trade leveled off. The population got a little older. The police force got a little better. Yet the effect was dramatic. So too with Hush Puppies. How many kids are we talking about who began wearing the shoes in downtown Manhattan? Twenty? Fifty? One hundred — at the most? Yet their actions seem to have single-handedly started an international fashion trend. Finally, both changes happened in a hurry. They didn't build steadily and slowly. It is instructive to look at a chart of the crime rate in New York City from, say, the mid1960s to the late 1990s. It looks like a giant arch. In 1965, there were 200,000 crimes in the city and Irom that point on the number begins a sharp rise, doubling in two years and continuing almost unbroken until it hits 650,000 crimes a year in the mid-1970s. It stays steady at that level for the next two decades, before plunging downward in 1992 as sharply as it rose thirty years earlier. These three characteristics — one, contagiousness; two, the fact that little causes can have big effects; and three, that change happens not gradually but at one dramatic moment — are the same three principles that define how measles moves through a grade-school classroom or the flu attacks every winter. Of the three, the third trait — the idea that epidemics can rise or fall in one dramatic moment — is the most important, because it is the principle that makes sense of the first two and that permits the greatest insight into why modern change happens the way it does. The name given to that one dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything can change all at once is the Tipping Point. Yawning is incredibly contagious. I made some of you reading this yawn simply by writing the word ""yawn."" The people who yawned when they saw you yawn, meanwhile, were infected by the sight of you yawning — which is a second kind of contagion. They might even have yawned if they only heard you yawn, because yawning is also aurally contagious: if you play an audiotape of a yawn to blind people, they'll yawn too. And finally, if you yawned as you read this, did the thought cross your mind — however unconsciously and fleetingly — that you might be tired? I suspect that for some of you it did, which means that yawns can also be emotionally contagious. Simply by writing the word, I can plant a feeling in your mind. Can the flu virus do that? Contagiousness, in other words, is an unexpected property of all kinds of things, and we have to remember that, if we are to recognize and diagnose epidemic change. This possibility of sudden change is at the center of the idea of the Tipping Point and might well be the hardest of all to accept. The expression first came into popular use in the 1970s to describe the flight to the suburbs of whites living in the older cities of the American Northeast. When the number of incoming African Americans in a particular neighborhood reached a certain point—20 percent, say — sociologists observed that the community would ""tip"": most of the remaining whites would leave almost immediately. The Tipping Point is the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point. There was a Tipping Point for violent crime in New York in the early 1990s, and a Tipping Point for the reemergence of Hush Puppies, just as there is a Tipping Point for the introduction of any new technology. Sharp introduced the first lowpriced fax machine in 1984, and sold about 80,000 of those machines in the United States in that first year. For the next three years, businesses slowly and steadily bought more and more faxes, until, in 1987, enough people had faxes that it made sense for everyone to get a fax. Nineteen eighty-seven was the fax machine Tipping Point. A million machines were sold that year, and by 1989 two million new machines had gone into operation. Cellular phones have followed the same trajectory. Through the 1990s, they got smaller and cheaper, and service got better until 1998, when the technology hit a Tipping Point and suddenly everyone had a cell phone."

out of much less than thin air. And now, just when you’d gotten familiar, if hot really comfortable, with the idea of a
big bang, along comes something new to worry about. A mysterious and universal pressure pervades all of space and
acts against the cosmic gravity that has tried to drag the universe back together ever since the big bang. On top of
that, “negative gravity” has forced the expansion of the universe to accelerate exponentially, and cosmic gravity is
losing the tug-of-war.
For these and similarly mind-warping ideas in twentieth-century physics, just blame Albert Einstein.
Einstein hardly ever set foot in the laboratory; he didn’t test phenomena or use elaborate equipment. He was a theorist who perfected the “thought experiment,” in which you engage nature through your imagination, inventing a situation or a model and then working out the consequences of some physical principle.
If—as was the case for Einstein—a physicist’s model is intended to represent the entire universe, then manipulating
the model should be tantamount to manipulating the universe itself. Observers and experimentalists can then go out
and look for the phenomena predicted by that model. If the model is flawed, or if the theorists make a mistake in their 
calculations, the observers will detect a mismatch between the model’s predictions and the way things happen in the
real universe. That’s the first cue to try again, either by adjusting the old model or by creating a new one. "

combining those keywords. Can those words appear individually in a page, or do they have to be right next to each
other? Will the engine search for both keywords or for either keyword?
Phrase Searches
Google defaults to searching for occurrences of your specified keywords anywhere on the page, whether side-by-side
or scattered throughout. To return results of pages containing specifically ordered words, enclose them in quotes,
turning your keyword search into a phrase search, to use Google’s terminology.
On entering a search for the keywords:
to be or not to be
Google will find matches where the keywords appear anywhere on the page. If you want Google to find you matches
where the keywords appear together as a phrase, surround them with quotes, like this:
“to be or not to be”
Google will return matches only where those words appear together (not to mention explicitly including stop words
such as “to” and “or” […]).
Phrase searches are also useful when you want to find a phrase but aren’t sure of the exact wording. This is accomplished in combination with wildcards […])
Basic Boolean
Whether an engine searches for all keywords or any of them depends on what is called its Boolean default. Search
engines can default to Boolean AND (searching for all keywords) or Boolean OR (searching for any keywords). Of
course, even if a search engine defaults to searching for all keywords, you can usually give it a special command to
instruct it to search for any keyword. Lacking specific instructions, the engine falls back on its default setting.
Google’s Boolean default is AND, which means that, if you enter query words without modifiers, Google will search or
all of your query words. For example if you search for:
snowblower Honda “Green Bay”
Google will search for all the words. If you prefer to specify that any one word or phrase is acceptable, put an OR
between each:
snowblower OR Honda OR “Green Bay”.

of reality. Finding that Higgs field will give us a more complete understanding about how the universe works.

the wheel does not lock up. As these systems proliferated in the 1990s, manufacturers tacked on traction-control
valves that help a spinning drive wheel grip the road.
For stability control, engineers mounted more hydraulics that can apply pressure to any wheel, even if the driver is
not braking. When sensors indicate the car is sliding forward instead of turning or is turning too sharply, the actuators
momentarily brake certain wheels to correct the trajectory. Going to electronic stability control was a big step, says
Scott Dahl, director of chassis-control strategy at supplier Robert Bosch in Farmington Hills, Michigan. We had to

189,“The Coming Merger of Mind and Machine.”,"Kurzweil, Ray",b201_TheComingMergerofMindandMachine.txt,6,"Sometime early in the next century, the intelligence of machines will exceed that of humans. Within several decades, machines will exhibit the full range of human intellect, emotions and skills, ranging from musical and other creative aptitudes to physical movement. They will claim to have feelings and, unlike today’s virtual personalities, will be very convincing when they tell us so. By 2019 a $1,000 computer will at least match the processing power of the human brain. By 2029 the software for intelligence will have been largely mastered, and the average personal computer will be equivalent to 1,000 brains.

Within three decades, the author maintains, neural implants will be available that interface directly to our brain cells. The implants would enhance sensory experiences and improve our memory and thinking.

Once computers achieve a level of intelligence comparable to that of humans, they will necessarily soar past it. For example, if I learn French, I can’t readily download that learning to you. The reason is that for us, learning involves successions of stunningly complex patterns of interconnections among brain cells (neurons) and among the concentrations of biochemicals, known as neurotransmitters, that enable impulses to travel from neuron to neuron. We have no way of quickly downloading these patterns. But quick downloading will allow our nonbiological creations to share immediately what they learn with billions of other machines. Ultimately, nonbiological entities will master not only the sum total of their own knowledge but all of ours as well.

As this happens, there will no longer be a clear distinction between human and machine. We are already putting computers–neural implants–directly into people’s brains to counteract Parkinson’s disease and tremors from multiple sclerosis. We have cochlear implants that restore hearing. A retinal implant is being developed in the U.S. that is intended to provide at least some visual perception for some blind individuals, basically by replacing certain visual-processing circuits of the brain. Recently scientists from Emory University implanted a chip in the brain of a paralyzed stroke victim that allows him to use his brainpower to move a cursor across a computer screen.

In the 2020s neural implants will improve our sensory experiences, memory and thinking. By 2030, instead of just phoning a friend, you will be able to meet in, say, a virtual Mozambican game preserve that will seem compellingly real. You will be able to have any type of experience–business, social, sexual–with anyone, real or simulated, regardless of physical proximity.

How Life and Technology Evolve
To gain insight into the kinds of forecasts I have just made, it is important to recognize that technology is advancing exponentially. An exponential process starts slowly, but eventually its pace increases extremely rapidly. (A fuller documentation of my argument is contained in my new book, The Age of Spiritual Machines.)

The evolution of biological life and the evolution of technology have both followed the same pattern they take a long time to get going, but advances build on one another and progress erupts at an increasingly furious pace. We are entering that explosive part of the technological evolution curve right now.

Consider It took billions of years for Earth to form. It took two billion more for life to begin and almost as long for molecules to organize into the first multicellular plants and animals about 700 million years ago. The pace of evolution quickened as mammals inherited Earth some 65 million years ago. With the emergence of primates, evolutionary progress was measured in mere millions of years, leading to Homo sapiens perhaps 500,000 years ago.

The evolution of technology has been a continuation of the evolutionary process that gave rise to us-the technology-creating species-in the first place. It took tens of thousands of years for our ancestors to figure out that sharpening both sides of a stone created useful tools. Then, earlier in this millennium, the time required for a major paradigm shift in technology had shrunk to hundreds of years.

The pace continued to accelerate during the 19th century, during which technological progress was equal to that of the 10 centuries that came before it. Advancement in the first two decades of the 20th century matched that of the entire 19th century. Today significant technological transformations take just a few years; for example, the World Wide Web, already a ubiquitous form of communication and commerce, did not exist just nine years ago.

Computing technology is experiencing the same exponential growth. Over the past several decades, a key factor in this expansion has been described by Moore’s Law. Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, noted in the mid-1960s that technologists had been doubling the density of transistors on integrated circuits every 12 months. This meant computers were periodically doubling both in capacity and in speed per unit cost. In the mid-1970s Moore revised his observation of the doubling time to a more accurate estimate of about 24 months, and that trend has persisted through the 1990s.

After decades of devoted service, Moore’s Law will have run its course around 2019. By that time, transistor features will be just a few atoms in width. But new computer architectures will continue the exponential growth of computing. For example, computing cubes are already being designed that will provide thousands of layers of circuits, not just one as in today’s computer chips. Other technologies that promise orders-of-magnitude increases in computing density include nanotube circuits built from carbon atoms, optical computing, crystalline computing and molecular computing.

We can readily see the march of computing by plotting the speed (in instructions per second) per $1,000 (in constant dollars) of 49 famous calculating machines spanning the 20th century [see graph below]. The graph is a study in exponential growth computer speed per unit cost doubled every three years between 1910 and 1950 and every two years between 1950 and 1966 and is now doubling every year. It took 90 years to achieve the first $1,000 computer capable of executing one million instructions per second (MIPS). Now we add an additional MIPS to a $1,000 computer every day.

Why Returns Accelerate
Why do we see exponential progress occurring in biological life, technology and computing It is the result of a fundamental attribute of any evolutionary process, a phenomenon I call the Law of Accelerating Returns. As order exponentially increases (which reflects the essence of evolution), the time between salient events grows shorter. Advancement speeds up. The returns–the valuable products of the process–accelerate at a nonlinear rate. The escalating growth in the price performance of computing is one important example of such accelerating returns.

A frequent criticism of predictions is that they rely on an unjustified extrapolation of current trends, without considering the forces that may alter those trends. But an evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on past achievements, including improvements in its own means for further evolution. The resources it needs to continue exponential growth are its own increasing order and the chaos in the environment in which the evolutionary process takes place, which provides the options for further diversity. These two resources are essentially without limit.

The Law of Accelerating Returns shows that by 2019 a $1,000 personal computer will have the processing power of the human brain–20 million billion calculations per second. Neuroscientists came up with this figure by taking an estimation of the number of neurons in the brain, 100 billion, and multiplying it by 1,000 connections per neuron and 200 calculations per second per connection. By 2055, $1,000 worth of computing will equal the processing power of all human brains on Earth (of course, I may be off by a year or two).

The accelerating rate of progress in computing is demonstrated by this graph, which shows the amount of computing speed that $1,000 (in constant dollars) would buy, plotted as a function of time. Computer power per unit cost is now doubling every year.

Programming Intelligence
That’s the prediction for processing power, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving human-level intelligence in machines. Of greater importance is the software of intelligence.

One approach to creating this software is to painstakingly program the rules of complex processes. We are getting good at this task in certain cases; the CYC (as in “encyclopedia”) system designed by Douglas B. Lenat of Cycorp has more than one million rules that describe the intricacies of human common sense, and it is being applied to Internet search engines so that they return smarter answers to our queries.

Another approach is “complexity theory” (also known as chaos theory) computing, in which self-organizing algorithms gradually learn patterns of information in a manner analogous to human learning. One such method, neural nets, is based on simplified mathematical models of mammalian neurons. Another method, called genetic (or evolutionary) algorithms, is based on allowing intelligent solutions to develop gradually in a simulated process of evolution.

Ultimately, however, we will learn to program intelligence by copying the best intelligent entity we can get our hands on the human brain itself. We will reverse-engineer the human brain, and fortunately for us it’s not even copyrighted!

The most immediate way to reach this goal is by destructive scanning take a brain frozen just before it was about to expire and examine one very thin slice at a time to reveal every neuron, interneuronal connection and concentration of neurotransmitters across each gap between neurons (these gaps are called synapses). One condemned killer has already allowed his brain and body to be scanned, and all 15 billion bytes of him can be accessed on the National Library of Medicine’s Web site. The resolution of these scans is not nearly high enough for our purposes, but the data at least enable us to start thinking about these issues.

We also have noninvasive scanning techniques, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and others. Their increasing resolution and speed will eventually enable us to resolve the connections between neurons. The rapid improvement is again a result of the Law of Accelerating Returns, because massive computation is the main element in higher-resolution imaging.

Another approach would be to send microscopic robots (or “nanobots”) into the bloodstream and program them to explore every capillary, monitoring the brain’s connections and neurotransmitter concentrations.

Fantastic Voyage
Although sophisticated robots that small are still several decades away at least, their utility for probing the innermost recesses of our bodies would be far-reaching. They would communicate wirelessly with one another and report their findings to other computers. The result would be a noninvasive scan of the brain taken from within.

Most of the technologies required for this scenario already exist, though not in the microscopic size required. Miniaturizing them to the tiny sizes needed, however, would reflect the essence of the Law of Accelerating Returns. For example, the translators on an integrated circuit have been shrinking by a factor of approximately 5.6 in each linear dimension every 10 years.

The capabilities of these embedded nanobots would not be limited to passive roles such as monitoring. Eventually they could be built to communicate directly with the neuronal circuits in our brains, enhancing or extending our mental capabilities. We already have electronic devices that can communicate with neurons by detecting their activity and either triggering nearby neurons to fire or suppressing them from firing. The embedded nanobots will be capable of reprogramming neural connections to provide virtual-reality experiences and to enhance our pattern recognition and other cognitive faculties.

To decode and understand the brain’s information-processing methods (which, incidentally, combine both digital and analog methods), it is not necessary to see every connection, because there is a great deal of redundancy within each region. We are already applying insights from early stages of this reverse-engineering process. For example, in speech recognition, we have already decoded and copied the brain’s early stages of sound processing.

Perhaps more interesting than this scanning-the-brain-to-understand-it approach would be scanning the brain for the purpose of downloading it. We would map the locations, interconnections, and contents of all the neurons, synapses and neurotransmitter concentrations. The entire organization, including the brain’s memory, would then be re-created on a digital-analog computer.

To do this, we would need to understand local brain processes, and progress is already under way. Theodore W. Berger and his co-workers at the University of Southern California have built integrated circuits that precisely match the processing characteristics of substantial clusters of neurons. Carver A. Mead and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology have built a variety of integrated circuits that emulate the digital-analog characteristics of mammalian neural circuits.

Developing complete maps of the human brain is not as daunting as it may sound. The Human Genome Project seemed impractical when it was first proposed. At the rate at which it was possible to scan genetic codes 12 years ago, it would have taken thousands of years to complete the genome. But in accordance with the Law of Accelerating Returns, the ability to sequence DNA has been accelerating. The latest estimates are that the entire human genome will be completed in just a few years.

By the third decade of the 21st century, we will be in a position to create complete, detailed maps of the computationally relevant features of the human brain and to re-create these designs in advanced neural computers. We will provide a variety of bodies for our machines, too, from virtual bodies in virtual reality to bodies comprising swarms of nanobots. In fact, humanoid robots that ambulate and have lifelike facial expressions are already being developed at several laboratories in Tokyo.

Will It Be Conscious
Such possibilities prompt a host of intriguing issues and questions. Suppose we scan someone’s brain and reinstate the resulting “mind file” into a suitable computing medium. Will the entity that emerges from such an operation be conscious This being would appear to others to have very much the same personality, history and memory. For some, that is enough to define consciousness. For others, such as physicist and author James Trefil, no logical reconstruction can attain human consciousness, although Trefil concedes that computers may become conscious in some new way.

At what point do we consider an entity to be conscious, to be self-aware, to have free will How do we distinguish a process that is conscious from one that just acts as if it is conscious If the entity is very convincing when it says, “I’m lonely, please keep me company,” does that settle the issue

If you ask the “person” in the machine, it will strenuously claim to be the original person. If we scan, let’s say, me and reinstate that information into a neural computer, the person who emerges will think he is (and has been) me (or at least he will act that way). He will say, “I grew up in Queens, New York, went to college at M.I.T., stayed in the Boston area, walked into a scanner there and woke up in the machine here. Hey, this technology really works.” But wait, is this really me For one thing, old Ray (that’s me) still exists in my carbon-cell-based brain.

Will the new entity be capable of spiritual experiences Because its brain processes are effectively identical, its behavior will be comparable to that of the person it is based on. So it will certainly claim to have the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that a person claims to have.

No objective test can absolutely determine consciousness. We cannot objectively measure subjective experience (this has to do with the very nature of the concepts “objective” and “subjective”). We can measure only correlates of it, such as behavior. The new entities will appear to be conscious, and whether or not they actually are will not affect their behavior. Just as we debate today the consciousness of nonhuman entities such as animals, we will surely debate the potential consciousness of nonbiological intelligent entities. From a practical perspective, we will accept their claims. They’ll get mad if we don’t.

Before the next century is over, the Law of Accelerating Returns tells us, Earth’s technology-creating species-us-will merge with our own technology. And when that happens, we might ask What is the difference between a human brain enhanced a millionfold by neural implants and a nonbiological intelligence based on the reverse-engineering of the human brain that is subsequently enhanced and expanded

The engine of evolution used its innovation from one period (humans) to create the next (intelligent machines). The subsequent milestone will be for the machines to create their own next generation without human intervention.

An evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on its own means for further evolution. Humans have beaten evolution. We are creating intelligent entities in considerably less time than it took the evolutionary process that created us. Human intelligence–a product of evolution–has transcended it. So, too, the intelligence that we are now creating in computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its creators."
190,“Untangling the Roots of Cancer.”,"Gibbs, W Wayt",b202_UntanglingtheRootsofCancer.txt,6,"What causes cancer?

Tobacco smoke, most people would say. Probably too much alcohol, sunshine or grilled meat; infection with cervical papillomaviruses; asbestos. All have strong links to cancer, certainly. But they cannot be root causes. Much of the population is exposed to these carcinogens, yet only a tiny minority suffers dangerous tumors as a consequence.

A cause, by definition, leads invariably to its effect. The immediate cause of cancer must be some combination of insults and accidents that induces normal cells in a healthy human body to turn malignant, growing like weeds and sprouting in unnatural places.


At this level, the cause of cancer is not entirely a mystery. In fact, a decade ago many geneticists were confident that science was homing in on a final answer: cancer is the result of cumulative mutations that alter specific locations in a cell's DNA and thus change the particular proteins encoded by cancer-related genes at those spots. The mutations affect two kinds of cancer genes. The first are called tumor suppressors. They normally restrain cells' ability to divide, and mutations permanently disable the genes. The second variety, known as oncogenes, stimulate growthin other words, cell division. Mutations lock oncogenes into an active state. Some researchers still take it as axiomatic that such growth-promoting changes to a small number of cancer genes are the initial event and root cause of every human cancer.

For the past few years, however, prominent oncologists have increasingly challenged that theory. No one questions that cancer is ultimately a disease of the DNA. But as biologists trace tumors to their roots, they have discovered many other abnormalities at work inside the nuclei of cells that, though not yet cancerous, are headed that way. Whole chromosomes, each containing 1,000 or more genes, are often lost or duplicated. Pieces of chromosomes are frequently scrambled, truncated or fused together. Chemical additions to the DNA, or to the histone proteins around which it coils, somehow silence important genes, but in a reversible process quite different from mutation. And scans of the genomes of malignant cells within tumors have found that they typically harbor myriad rare mutations rather than a handful of common genetic alterations.

The accumulating evidence has spawned new hypotheses that compete with the standard dogma to explain what changes come first and which aberrations matter most in the decadelong transformation of a cell and its descendants from well-behaved tissue to invasive tumor. The challengers dispute the dominant view of the disease as the product of a defined genetic state. They argue that it is more useful to think of cancer as the consequence of a chaotic process, a combination of Murphy's Law and Darwin's Law: anything that can go wrong will, and in a competitive environment, the most prolific variants will dominate.

Despite that shared underlying principle, the new theories make different predictions about what kind of treatments will work best. Some suggest that many cancers could be prevented altogether by better screening, changes in diet, and new drugsor even by old drugs, such as aspirin. Other theories cast doubt on that hope.

Marks of Malignancy
A WORKABLE THEORY of cancer has to explain both why it is predominantly a disease of old age and why we do not all die from it. A 70-year-old is roughly 100 times as likely to be diagnosed with a malignancy as a 19-year-old is. Yet most people make it to old age without getting cancer.



Biologists estimate that more than 10 million billion cells must cooperate to keep a human being healthy over the course of an 80-year life span. If any one of those myriad cells could give rise to a tumor, why is it that fewer than half the population will ever contract a cancer serious enough to catch a doctor's attention?

One explanation is that a cell must acquire several extraordinary skills to be malignant. Five or six different regulatory systems must be perturbed in order for a normal cell to grow as a cancer, asserts Robert A. Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a 2002 review paper, he and William C. Hahn of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston argued that all life-threatening cancers manifest at least six such deranged abilities. (Although Weinberg is one of the founding proponents of the standard paradigm, even those who challenge that theory tend to agree with this view.)

For example, cancer cells continue dividing in situations in which normal cells would quietly wait for a special chemical signalsay, from an injured neighbor. Somehow they counterfeit these progrowth messages. Conversely, tumor cells must ignore stop dividing commands that are sent out by the adjacent tissues they squeeze and by their own internal aging mechanisms.

All cancerous cells have serious problems of some sort with their DNA, and as they double again and again, many cells in the resulting colony end up far from the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients. Such stresses trigger autodestruct mechanisms in healthy cells. Tumor cells find some way to avoid this kind of suicide. Then they have to persuade nearby blood vessels to build the infrastructure they need to thrive.

A fifth derangement that almost all cancers acquire is immortality. A culture of normal human cells stops dividing after 50 to 70 generations. That is more than enough doublings to sustain a person through even a century of healthy life. But the great majority of cells in tumors quickly die of their genetic defects, so those rare few that survive must reproduce indefinitely if the tumor is to grow. The survivors do so in part by manipulating their telomeres, gene-free complexes of DNA and protein that protect the ends of each chromosome.


Tumors that develop these five faculties are trouble, but they are probably not deadly. It is a sixth property, the ability to invade nearby tissue and then metastasize to distant parts of the body, that gives cancer its lethal character. Local invasions can usually be removed surgically. But nine of every 10 deaths from the disease are the result of metastases.

Only an elite few cells in a tumor seem to acquire this ability to detach from the initial mass, float through the circulation and start a new colony in a different organ from the one that gave birth to them. Unfortunately, by the time they are discovered, many cancers have already metastasizedincluding, in the U.S., 76 percent of lung cancers, 55 percent of colorectal cancers, and 37 percent of breast cancers. By then the prognosis is frequently grim.

The Order of Disorder
DOCTORS COULD CATCH incipient tumors sooner if scientists could trace the steps that cells take down the road to cancer after the initial assault to their DNA by a carcinogen or some random biochemical mishap. Researchers broadly agree on the traits of the diseased cells that emerge from the journey. It is the propelling force and the order of each milestone that are under active debate.

The dominant paradigm for 30 years has been that tumors grow in spurts of mutation and expansion. Genetic damage to a cell deletes or disrupts a tumor suppressor geneRB, p53, BRCA2 and APC are among the best knownthereby suppressing proteins that normally ensure the integrity of the genome and the process of cell division. Alternatively, a mutation may increase the activity of an oncogenesuch as HER2/NEU, c-fos or c-erbB3whose proteins then stimulate the cell to reproduce.

Changes to cancer genes free the cell of one or more normal restraints, allowing it to outbreed its neighbors. The cell passes abnormalities in its DNA sequence on to its descendants, which become a kind of clone army that grows to the limits of its capacity. Eventually another random mutation to a cancer gene looses another shackle, initiating another burst of growth.



Cells normally have two copies of every chromosomeone from the mother, the other from the fatherand thus two copies, or alleles, of every gene. (In males, the single X and Y chromosomes are notable exceptions.) A mutation to just one allele is enough to activate an oncogene permanently. But it takes two hits to knock out both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene. Four to 10 mutations in the right genes can transform any cell. Or so the theory goes.

The mutant-gene paradigm gained almost universal acceptance because it explained very well what scientists saw in their experiments on genetically engineered mice and human cell cultures. But new technologies now allow researchers to survey large fractions of the genomes of cancerous and precancerous cells taken directly from people. Many recent observations seem to contradict the idea that mutations to a few specific genes lie at the root of all cancers.

Unexplained Phenomena
IN 2003, for example, a team led by Michael F. Clarke, then at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and now at Stanford University, reported that it had identified distinguishing marks for a rare subset of cells within human breast cancers that can form new tumors. As few as 100 cells of this type quickly spawned disease when injected into mice lacking an immune system. Tens of thousands of other cells, harvested from the same nine breast malignancies but lacking the telltale marks, failed to do so. These were the first tumor-initiating cells ever isolated for solid tumors, and later studies confirmed that for many common human cancers, just a small fraction of the cells in a tumor are responsible for its growth and metastasisand so for the illness and death of the patient. The discovery of such cells, which some began calling cancer stem cells, posed a problem for the mutant-gene theory of cancer. If mutations, which are copied from a cell to its progeny, give tumor cells their deranged powers, then shouldn't all clones in the army be equally powerful?

In fact, most tumors are not masses of identical clones. On the contrary, closer examination has revealed amazing genetic diversity among their cells, some of which are so different from normal human cells (and from one another) that they might fairly be called new species.

In 2006 Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University and a large team of collaborators used new genetic sequencing technologies to examine more than 13,000 genes in samples taken from 11 breast tumors and 11 colorectal cancers. They found noninherited mutations in 1,149 (nearly 9 percent) of those genes. Even more startling than the sheer number of genes mutated was the lack of consistency from one tumor to the nextor even from one cell to another within the same tumor. Not a single gene was mutated in more than 5 percent of the tumors.



Moreover, some of the most commonly altered cancer genes have oddly inconsistent effects. Vogelstein's group has also reported that the much studied oncogenes c-fos and c-erbB3 are curiously less active in tumors than they are in nearby normal tissues. The tumor suppressor gene RB was shown to be hyperactivenot disabledin some colon cancers, and, perversely, it appears to protect those tumors from their autodestruct mechanisms.

The two hit hypothesisthat both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene must be deactivatedhas also been upended by the discovery of a phenomenon called haploinsufficiency. In some cancers, it turns out, tumor suppressors are not mutated at all. Their output is simply reduced, and that seems to be enough to push cells toward malignancy. This effect has now been seen for more than a dozen tumor suppressor genes, and investigators expect to find many more like them. Searching for the mere presence or absence of a gene's protein is too simplistic. Dosage matters.

Beyond Mutation
RESEARCHERS are now looking more closely at other phenomena, besides errors in a gene's DNA sequence, that can dramatically alter the dosage of a protein in a cell. The loss or gain of a chromosome (or part of one) containing the gene can do this. So can tweaks to regulatory factors that control how often a gene is translated into protein, as well as epigenetic phenomena that alter gene activity by reversible means. All these changes are nearly ubiquitous in established cancers.

If you look at most solid tumors in adults, it looks like someone set off a bomb in the nucleus, Hahn says. In most cells, there are big pieces of chromosomes hooked together and duplications or losses of whole chromosomes. Cancer biologists call such cells aneuploid.

Almost a century ago German biologist Theodor Boveri noticed the strange imbalance in cancer cells between the numbers of maternal versus paternal chromosomes. He even suggested that aneuploid cells might cause the disease. But scientists could find no recurrent pattern to the chromosomal chaosindeed, the genome of a typical cancer cell is not merely aneuploid but unstable as well, changing every few generations. So Boveri's idea was dropped as the search for oncogenes started to bear fruit. The aneuploidy and massive genomic instability inside tumor cells were dismissed as side effects of cancer, not prerequisites.

But the oncogene/tumor suppressor gene hypothesis has also failed, despite three decades of effort, to identify a particular set of gene mutations that occurs in every instance of any of the most common and deadly kinds of human cancer. So now, Hahn says, the question is which comes first: mutations or aneuploidy?

There are at least four competing answers. The newest and most controversial theorythat cancers often arise from the very stem cells that give healthy organs their growth and healing abilitiesis discussed elsewhere in this issue [see Stem Cells: The Real Culprits in Cancer? by Michael F. Clarke and Michael W. Becker, on page 40]. So we will focus on the three more established ideas. Let us call them the modified dogma, the early instability theory and the all-aneuploidy theory. Encouragingly, all four of these theories seem to be converging as they bend to accommodate new experimental results.

The modified form of the standard dogma revives an idea proposed in 1974 by Lawrence A. Loeb, now at the University of Washington. He and other geneticists have estimated that, on average, random mutation will affect just one gene in any given cell over the course of a lifetime. Somethinga carcinogen, reactive oxidants, or perhaps a malfunction in the DNA duplication and repair machinery of the cellmust dramatically accelerate the mutation rate, Loeb argues.

For many years, he suggested that early during the genesis of cancer there are enormous numbers of random mutations10,000 to 100,000 per cell, but he had little evidence to support the idea. In 2006, however, technology advanced to the point that Loeb was able to test his hypothesis by comparing the rate at which a noncoding portion of the p53 gene suffered small mutations in both normal and malignant human cells. Cancerous cells, his test revealed, harbored anywhere from 65 to 475 mutations per 100 million nucleotides, whereas normal cells had four or fewer. That seems to be a far stretch from the 100,000-fold increase in mutation rate that Loeb had anticipated, but it is nonetheless an important discovery that demands explanation.

Loeb's modified dogma thus may add a prologue to the long-accepted life history of cancer. But the most important plot points in that story would still remain the same: mutations to genes that serve to increase the reproductive success of cells. Mangled and ever changing chromosomes are, in this narrative, mere fortuitous by-products.

Unstable from the Outset
VOGELSTEIN of Johns Hopkins and his former co-worker Christoph Lengauer, now at Novartis, proposed an alternative theory in which chromosomal instability can occur early on. The genetic flux then combines forces with natural selection to produce a benign growth that may later be converted to an invasive malignancy and life-threatening metastases.

In their hypothesis, there are several master genes whose function is critical for a cell to reproduce correctly. If just one of these genes is disabled, either epigenetically or by mutation, the cell stumbles each time it attempts the carefully choreographed dance of cell division, muddling some of the chromosomes into an aneuploid state. One result is to increase 100,000-fold the rate at which cells randomly lose one of the two alleles of their genes. For a tumor suppressor gene, a lost allele may effectively put the gene out of commission, either because the remaining copy is already mutated or because of the haploinsufficiency effect. Lengauer and Vogelstein still assume that some cancer genes must be altered before a malignancy can erupt.

Some observations do support the early instability theory. In 2000 Lengauer's laboratory examined colon adenomasbenign polyps that occasionally turn malignantand observed that more than 90 percent had extra or missing pieces of at least one chromosome. More than half had lost the long arm of chromosome 5, home to the APC tumor suppressor gene, long implicated in the formation of colon cancer. Other researchers have discovered similarly aberrant chromosomes in precancerous growths taken from the stomach, esophagus and breast.

The early instability theory still has some loose ends, however. How can cells with shifty chromosomes outcompete their stable counterparts? Under normal conditions, they probably do not, suggests immunologist Jarle Breivik of the University of Oslo. But in a war zone, where a carcinogen or other stressor is continually inflicting damage to cells, normal cells stop dividing until they have completed repairs to their DNA. Genetically unstable cells get that way because their DNA repair systems are already broken. So they simply ignore the damage, keep on proliferating, and thus pull ahead, Breivik hypothesizes.

But what jumbles the chromosomes in the first place? No genes have yet been conclusively identified as master genes, although several strong suspects have surfaced. Beth A. A. Weaver of the University of WisconsinMadison and her collaborators may have uncovered a clue in their studies of a gene called CENP-E. The protein produced from this gene is one of several that are crucial for guiding the chromosomes as they replicate and separate during cell division. At a meeting of the Society for Chromosomal Cancer Research in Oakland, Calif., this year, Weaver reported that in mice embryos missing one of their two copies of CENP-E (and thus making only half the normal amount of CENP-E protein), chromosomes quickly went askew. Within a couple of weeks, more than half the embryonic cells were aneuploid. And when these animals grew up, they developed many more spleen and lung cancers than did control mice with normal CENP-E genes.

Aneuploidy All the Way Down
ON THE OTHER HAND, maybe cells can become malignant even before any master genes, oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes are mutated. Peter Duesberg of the University of California, Berkeley, has put forth a third theory: nearly all cancer cells are aneuploid (leukemia being one exception) because they start that way. Lots of things can interfere with a dividing cell so that one of its daughter cells is cheated of its normal complement of 46 chromosomes and the other daughter is endowed with a bonus. Asbestos fibers, Duesberg notes, can physically disrupt the process.

Most aneuploid cells are stillborn or growth-retarded. But in the rare survivor, he suggests, the dosage of thousands of genes is altered. That corrupts teams of enzymes that synthesize and maintain DNA. Breaks appear in the double helix, destabilizing the genome further. The more aneuploid the cell is, the more unstable it is, and the more likely it will produce new combinations of chromosomes that will allow it to grow anywhere, Duesberg explains.

Unlike the three other theories, the all-aneuploidy hypothesis predicts that the emergence and progress of a tumor are more closely connected to the assortment of chromosomes in its cells than to the mutations in the genes on those chromosomes. Some observations do seem to corroborate the idea.

Thomas Ried, chief of cancer genomics at the National Cancer Institute, has obtained supporting evidence in humans from his investigation of aneuploidy in cervical and colorectal cancers, which he presented at the Oakland conference. Unequivocally, there are recurrent patterns of genomic imbalances, Ried avers. Every single case of [nonhereditary] colorectal cancer, for example, has gains of chromosomes 7, 8, 13 or 20or a loss of 18. In cervical cancer, aneuploidy of chromosome 3 happens very early, and those cells seem to have a selective advantage. Ried finds the average number of abnormal chromosomes increasing gradually from 0.2 in a normal cell to 12 in the cells of metastatic colon tumors.

So I actually think Duesberg is right that aneuploidy can be the first genetic aberration in cancer cells, Ried says. But he also argues that no gene mutations are required. This is simply not true.

Stopping Cancer at Its Roots
NEITHER THE standard dogma nor any of the new theories that challenge it can fully untangle the knotted roots of the 100-odd diseases we call cancer and explain them as variations of a single principle. And all the theories will need to be expanded to incorporate the still mysterious role of epigenetic phenomena, which may be pivotal.

It is important to determine which of the ideas is more right than the others, because they each make different predictions about the kinds of therapy that will succeed best against the most common and lethal cancers. In the standard view, tumors are in effect addicted to the proteins produced by oncogenes and are poisoned by tumor suppressor proteins. Medicines should therefore be designed to break the addiction or supply the poison. Indeed, this strategy is exploited by some newer drugs, such as Gleevec (for rare forms of leukemia and stomach cancer) and Herceptin (for one variety of advanced breast cancer).

But all existing therapies, including Gleevec and Herceptin, fail in some patients because their tumors evolve into a resistant strain. Loeb fears that there may be no easy way around that problem; his latest work, after all, suggests that a tumor of any significant size harbors up to a trillion random mutations. If I am right, then within any given tumor, there will be cells with random mutations that protect them from any treatment you can conceive, Loeb says. So the best you can hope for is to delay the tumor's growth. You are not going to cure it.

For the elderlywho, after all, are the main victims of cancera sufficient delay may be as good as a cure. And even better than slowing the growth of a tumor would be to delay its formation in the first place. If Lengauer, Weaver and others succeed in identifying master genes, then it should also be possible to make drugs that protect or restore their function. The Johns Hopkins group has already licensed some of its cell lines to the pharmaceutical industry to use in drug screening.

Screening of a different kind may be the best approach if the all-aneuploidy theory is correct. There are no known means of selectively killing cells with abnormal chromosomes. But a biopsy that turns up a surfeit of aneuploid cells might warrant careful monitoring or even preventive surgery in certain cases. Duesberg suggests that foods, drugs and chemicals should be tested to identify compounds that cause aneuploidy. And Weaver found that although CENP-E-deficient mouse cells were highly tumorigenic if the cells were moderately aneuploid, cells that were highly aneuploid actually suppressed tumor formation. It may be possible to design drugs that kill cancer cells by exacerbating their aneuploidy.

One day science will produce a definitive answer to the question of what causes cancer. It will probably be a very complicated answer, and it may force us to shift our hope from drugs that cure the disease to medicines that prevent it. Even without a clear understanding of why, doctors have discovered that a daily baby aspirin seems to prevent colon adenomas and to lower the risk of one kind of breast cancer in some adults. The effect is small. But it is a step from chemotherapy toward a better alternative: chemoprevention."
191,"“The Cost Conundrum: Health Care Costs in McAllen, Texas.”","Gawande, Atul",b203_TheCostConundrumHealthCareCostsinMcAllenTexas.txt,6,"It is spring in McAllen, Texas. The morning sun is warm. The streets are lined with palm trees and pickup trucks. McAllen is in Hidalgo County, which has the lowest household income in the country, but its a border town, and a thriving foreign-trade zone has kept the unemployment rate below ten per cent. McAllen calls itself the Square Dance Capital of the World. Lonesome Dove was set around here.

McAllen has another distinction, too: it is one of the most expensive health-care markets in the country. Only Miamiwhich has much higher labor and living costsspends more per person on health care. In 2006, Medicare spent fifteen thousand dollars per enrollee here, almost twice the national average. The income per capita is twelve thousand dollars. In other words, Medicare spends three thousand dollars more per person here than the average person earns.

The explosive trend in American medical costs seems to have occurred here in an especially intense form. Our countrys health care is by far the most expensive in the world. In Washington, the aim of health-care reform is not just to extend medical coverage to everybody but also to bring costs under control. Spending on doctors, hospitals, drugs, and the like now consumes more than one of every six dollars we earn. The financial burden has damaged the global competitiveness of American businesses and bankrupted millions of families, even those with insurance. Its also devouring our government. The greatest threat to Americas fiscal health is not Social Security, President Barack Obama said in a March speech at the White House. Its not the investments that weve made to rescue our economy during this crisis. By a wide margin, the biggest threat to our nations balance sheet is the skyrocketing cost of health care. Its not even close.

The question were now frantically grappling with is how this came to be, and what can be done about it. McAllen, Texas, the most expensive town in the most expensive country for health care in the world, seemed a good place to look for some answers.

From the moment I arrived, I asked almost everyone I encountered about McAllens health costsa businessman I met at the five-gate McAllen-Miller International Airport, the desk clerks at the Embassy Suites Hotel, a police-academy cadet at McDonalds. Most werent surprised to hear that McAllen was an outlier. Just look around, the cadet said. People are not healthy here. McAllen, with its high poverty rate, has an incidence of heavy drinking sixty per cent higher than the national average. And the Tex-Mex diet has contributed to a thirty-eight-per-cent obesity rate.

One day, I went on rounds with Lester Dyke, a weather-beaten, ranch-owning fifty-three-year-old cardiac surgeon who grew up in Austin, did his surgical training with the Army all over the country, and settled into practice in Hidalgo County. He has not lacked for business: in the past twenty years, he has done some eight thousand heart operations, which exhausts me just thinking about it. I walked around with him as he checked in on ten or so of his patients who were recuperating at the three hospitals where he operates. It was easy to see what had landed them under his knife. They were nearly all obese or diabetic or both. Many had a family history of heart disease. Few were taking preventive measures, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, which, studies indicate, would have obviated surgery for up to half of them.

Yet public-health statistics show that cardiovascular-disease rates in the county are actually lower than average, probably because its smoking rates are quite low. Rates of asthma, H.I.V., infant mortality, cancer, and injury are lower, too. El Paso County, eight hundred miles up the border, has essentially the same demographics. Both counties have a population of roughly seven hundred thousand, similar public-health statistics, and similar percentages of non-English speakers, illegal immigrants, and the unemployed. Yet in 2006 Medicare expenditures (our best approximation of over-all spending patterns) in El Paso were $7,504 per enrolleehalf as much as in McAllen. An unhealthy population couldnt possibly be the reason that McAllens health-care costs are so high. (Or the reason that Americas are. We may be more obese than any other industrialized nation, but we have among the lowest rates of smoking and alcoholism, and we are in the middle of the range for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.)

Was the explanation, then, that McAllen was providing unusually good health care? I took a walk through Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, in Edinburg, one of the towns in the McAllen metropolitan area, with Robert Alleyn, a Houston-trained general surgeon who had grown up here and returned home to practice. The hospital campus sprawled across two city blocks, with a series of three- and four-story stucco buildings separated by golfing-green lawns and black asphalt parking lots. He pointed out the sightsthe cancer center is over here, the heart center is over there, now were coming to the imaging center. We went inside the surgery building. It was sleek and modern, with recessed lighting, classical music piped into the waiting areas, and nurses moving from patient to patient behind rolling black computer pods. We changed into scrubs and Alleyn took me through the sixteen operating rooms to show me the laparoscopy suite, with its flat-screen video monitors, the hybrid operating room with built-in imaging equipment, the surgical robot for minimally invasive robotic surgery.

I was impressed. The place had virtually all the technology that youd find at Harvard and Stanford and the Mayo Clinic, and, as I walked through that hospital on a dusty road in South Texas, this struck me as a remarkable thing. Rich towns get the new school buildings, fire trucks, and roads, not to mention the better teachers and police officers and civil engineers. Poor towns dont. But that rule doesnt hold for health care.

At McAllen Medical Center, I saw an orthopedic surgeon work under an operating microscope to remove a tumor that had wrapped around the spinal cord of a fourteen-year-old. At a home-health agency, I spoke to a nurse who could provide intravenous-drug therapy for patients with congestive heart failure. At McAllen Heart Hospital, I watched Dyke and a team of six do a coronary-artery bypass using technologies that didnt exist a few years ago. At Renaissance, I talked with a neonatologist who trained at my hospital, in Boston, and brought McAllen new skills and technologies for premature babies. Ive had nurses come up to me and say, I never knew these babies could survive,  he said.

And yet theres no evidence that the treatments and technologies available at McAllen are better than those found elsewhere in the country. The annual reports that hospitals file with Medicare show that those in McAllen and El Paso offer comparable technologiesneonatal intensive-care units, advanced cardiac services, pet scans, and so on. Public statistics show no difference in the supply of doctors. Hidalgo County actually has fewer specialists than the national average.

Nor does the care given in McAllen stand out for its quality. Medicare ranks hospitals on twenty-five metrics of care. On all but two of these, McAllens five largest hospitals performed worse, on average, than El Pasos. McAllen costs Medicare seven thousand dollars more per person each year than does the average city in America. But not, so far as one can tell, because its delivering better health care.



One night, I went to dinner with six McAllen doctors. All were what you would call bread-and-butter physicians: busy, full-time, private-practice doctors who work from seven in the morning to seven at night and sometimes later, their waiting rooms teeming and their desks stacked with medical charts to review.

Some were dubious when I told them that McAllen was the countrys most expensive place for health care. I gave them the spending data from Medicare. In 1992, in the McAllen market, the average cost per Medicare enrollee was $4,891, almost exactly the national average. But since then, year after year, McAllens health costs have grown faster than any other market in the country, ultimately soaring by more than ten thousand dollars per person.

Maybe the service is better here, the cardiologist suggested. People can be seen faster and get their tests more readily, he said.

Others were skeptical. I dont think that explains the costs hes talking about, the general surgeon said.

Its malpractice, a family physician who had practiced here for thirty-three years said.

McAllen is legal hell, the cardiologist agreed. Doctors order unnecessary tests just to protect themselves, he said. Everyone thought the lawyers here were worse than elsewhere.

That explanation puzzled me. Several years ago, Texas passed a tough malpractice law that capped pain-and-suffering awards at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Didnt lawsuits go down?

Practically to zero, the cardiologist admitted.

Come on, the general surgeon finally said. We all know these arguments are bullshit. There is overutilization here, pure and simple. Doctors, he said, were racking up charges with extra tests, services, and procedures.

The surgeon came to McAllen in the mid-nineties, and since then, he said, the way to practice medicine has changed completely. Before, it was about how to do a good job. Now it is about How much will you benefit? 

Everyone agreed that something fundamental had changed since the days when health-care costs in McAllen were the same as those in El Paso and elsewhere. Yes, they had more technology. But young doctors dont think anymore, the family physician said.

The surgeon gave me an example. General surgeons are often asked to see patients with pain from gallstones. If there arent any complicationsand there usually arentthe pain goes away on its own or with pain medication. With instruction on eating a lower-fat diet, most patients experience no further difficulties. But some have recurrent episodes, and need surgery to remove their gallbladder.

Seeing a patient who has had uncomplicated, first-time gallstone pain requires some judgment. A surgeon has to provide reassurance (people are often scared and want to go straight to surgery), some education about gallstone disease and diet, perhaps a prescription for pain; in a few weeks, the surgeon might follow up. But increasingly, I was told, McAllen surgeons simply operate. The patient wasnt going to moderate her diet, they tell themselves. The pain was just going to come back. And by operating they happen to make an extra seven hundred dollars.

I gave the doctors around the table a scenario. A forty-year-old woman comes in with chest pain after a fight with her husband. An EKG is normal. The chest pain goes away. She has no family history of heart disease. What did McAllen doctors do fifteen years ago?

Send her home, they said. Maybe get a stress test to confirm that theres no issue, but even that might be overkill.

And today? Today, the cardiologist said, she would get a stress test, an echocardiogram, a mobile Holter monitor, and maybe even a cardiac catheterization.

Oh, shes definitely getting a cath, the internist said, laughing grimly.

When you head off to camp your parents will want to see some separation anxiety.
When you head off to camp, your parents will want to see some separation anxiety.
To determine whether overuse of medical care was really the problem in McAllen, I turned to Jonathan Skinner, an economist at Dartmouths Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, which has three decades of expertise in examining regional patterns in Medicare payment data. I also turned to two private firmsD2Hawkeye, an independent company, and Ingenix, UnitedHealthcares data-analysis companyto analyze commercial insurance data for McAllen. The answer was yes. Compared with patients in El Paso and nationwide, patients in McAllen got more of pretty much everythingmore diagnostic testing, more hospital treatment, more surgery, more home care.

The Medicare payment data provided the most detail. Between 2001 and 2005, critically ill Medicare patients received almost fifty per cent more specialist visits in McAllen than in El Paso, and were two-thirds more likely to see ten or more specialists in a six-month period. In 2005 and 2006, patients in McAllen received twenty per cent more abdominal ultrasounds, thirty per cent more bone-density studies, sixty per cent more stress tests with echocardiography, two hundred per cent more nerve-conduction studies to diagnose carpal-tunnel syndrome, and five hundred and fifty per cent more urine-flow studies to diagnose prostate troubles. They received one-fifth to two-thirds more gallbladder operations, knee replacements, breast biopsies, and bladder scopes. They also received two to three times as many pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, cardiac-bypass operations, carotid endarterectomies, and coronary-artery stents. And Medicare paid for five times as many home-nurse visits. The primary cause of McAllens extreme costs was, very simply, the across-the-board overuse of medicine.

This is a disturbing and perhaps surprising diagnosis. Americans like to believe that, with most things, more is better. But research suggests that where medicine is concerned it may actually be worse. For example, Rochester, Minnesota, where the Mayo Clinic dominates the scene, has fantastically high levels of technological capability and quality, but its Medicare spending is in the lowest fifteen per cent of the country$6,688 per enrollee in 2006, which is eight thousand dollars less than the figure for McAllen. Two economists working at Dartmouth, Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra, found that the more money Medicare spent per person in a given state the lower that states quality ranking tended to be. In fact, the four states with the highest levels of spendingLouisiana, Texas, California, and Floridawere near the bottom of the national rankings on the quality of patient care.

In a 2003 study, another Dartmouth team, led by the internist Elliott Fisher, examined the treatment received by a million elderly Americans diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer, a hip fracture, or a heart attack. They found that patients in higher-spending regions received sixty per cent more care than elsewhere. They got more frequent tests and procedures, more visits with specialists, and more frequent admission to hospitals. Yet they did no better than other patients, whether this was measured in terms of survival, their ability to function, or satisfaction with the care they received. If anything, they seemed to do worse.

Thats because nothing in medicine is without risks. Complications can arise from hospital stays, medications, procedures, and tests, and when these things are of marginal value the harm can be greater than the benefits. In recent years, we doctors have markedly increased the number of operations we do, for instance. In 2006, doctors performed at least sixty million surgical procedures, one for every five Americans. No other country does anything like as many operations on its citizens. Are we better off for it? No one knows for sure, but it seems highly unlikely. After all, some hundred thousand people die each year from complications of surgeryfar more than die in car crashes.


To make matters worse, Fisher found that patients in high-cost areas were actually less likely to receive low-cost preventive services, such as flu and pneumonia vaccines, faced longer waits at doctor and emergency-room visits, and were less likely to have a primary-care physician. They got more of the stuff that cost more, but not more of what they needed.

In an odd way, this news is reassuring. Universal coverage wont be feasible unless we can control costs. Policymakers have worried that doing so would require rationing, which the public would never go along with. So the idea that theres plenty of fat in the system is proving deeply attractive. Nearly thirty per cent of Medicares costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level in low-cost areas, Peter Orszag, the Presidents budget director, has stated.

Most Americans would be delighted to have the quality of care found in places like Rochester, Minnesota, or Seattle, Washington, or Durham, North Carolinaall of which have world-class hospitals and costs that fall below the national average. If we brought the cost curve in the expensive places down to their level, Medicares problems (indeed, almost all the federal governments budget problems for the next fifty years) would be solved. The difficulty is how to go about it. Physicians in places like McAllen behave differently from others. The $2.4-trillion question is why. Unless we figure it out, health reform will fail.

Ihad what I considered to be a reasonable plan for finding out what was going on in McAllen. I would call on the heads of its hospitals, in their swanky, decorator-designed, churrigueresco offices, and Id ask them.

The first hospital I visited, McAllen Heart Hospital, is owned by Universal Health Services, a for-profit hospital chain with headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and revenues of five billion dollars last year. I went to see the hospitals chief operating officer, Gilda Romero. Truth be told, her office seemed less churrigueresco than Office Depot. She had straight brown hair, sympathetic eyes, and looked more like a young school teacher than like a corporate officer with nineteen years of experience. And when I inquired, What is going on in this place? she looked surprised.

Is McAllen really that expensive? she asked.

I described the data, including the numbers indicating that heart operations and catheter procedures and pacemakers were being performed in McAllen at double the usual rate.

That is interesting, she said, by which she did not mean, Uh-oh, youve caught us but, rather, That is actually interesting. The problem of McAllens outlandish costs was new to her. She puzzled over the numbers. She was certain that her doctors performed surgery only when it was necessary. It had to be one of the other hospitals. And she had one in mindDoctors Hospital at Renaissance, the hospital in Edinburg that I had toured.

She wasnt the only person to mention Renaissance. It is the newest hospital in the area. It is physician-owned. And it has a reputation (which it disclaims) for aggressively recruiting high-volume physicians to become investors and send patients there. Physicians who do so receive not only their fee for whatever service they provide but also a percentage of the hospitals profits from the tests, surgery, or other care patients are given. (In 2007, its profits totalled thirty-four million dollars.) Romero and others argued that this gives physicians an unholy temptation to overorder.

Such an arrangement can make physician investors rich. But it cant be the whole explanation. The hospital gets barely a sixth of the patients in the region; its margins are no bigger than the other hospitalswhether for profit or not for profitand it didnt have much of a presence until 2004 at the earliest, a full decade after the cost explosion in McAllen began.

Those are good points, Romero said. She couldnt explain what was going on.

The following afternoon, I visited the top managers of Doctors Hospital at Renaissance. We sat in their boardroom around one end of a yacht-length table. The chairman of the board offered me a soda. The chief of staff smiled at me. The chief financial officer shook my hand as if I were an old friend. The C.E.O., however, was having a hard time pretending that he was happy to see me. Lawrence Gelman was a fifty-seven-year-old anesthesiologist with a Bill Clinton shock of white hair and a weekly local radio show tag-lined Opinions from an Unrelenting Conservative Spirit. He had helped found the hospital. He barely greeted me, and while the others were trying for a how-can-I-help-you-today attitude, his body language was more lets-get-this-over-with.

So I asked him why McAllens health-care costs were so high. What he gave me was a disquisition on the theory and history of American health-care financing going back to Lyndon Johnson and the creation of Medicare, the upshot of which was: (1) Government is the problem in health care. The people in charge of the purse strings dont know what theyre doing. (2) If anything, government insurance programs like Medicare dont pay enough. I, as an anesthesiologist, know that they pay me ten per cent of what a private insurer pays. (3) Government programs are full of waste. Every person in this room could easily go through the expenditures of Medicare and Medicaid and see all kinds of waste. (4) But not in McAllen. The clinicians here, at least at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, are providing necessary, essential health care, Gelman said. We dont invent patients.

Then why do hospitals in McAllen order so much more surgery and scans and tests than hospitals in El Paso and elsewhere?

In the end, the only explanation he and his colleagues could offer was this: The other doctors and hospitals in McAllen may be overspending, but, to the extent that his hospital provides costlier treatment than other places in the country, it is making people better in ways that data on quality and outcomes do not measure.

Do we provide better health care than El Paso? Gelman asked. I would bet you two to one that we do.

It was a depressing conversationnot because I thought the executives were being evasive but because they werent being evasive. The data on McAllens costs were clearly new to them. They were defending McAllen reflexively. But they really didnt know the big picture of what was happening.

And, I realized, few people in their position do. Local executives for hospitals and clinics and home-health agencies understand their growth rate and their market share; they know whether they are losing money or making money. They know that if their doctors bring in enough businesssurgery, imaging, home-nursing referralsthey make money; and if they get the doctors to bring in more, they make more. But they have only the vaguest notion of whether the doctors are making their communities as healthy as they can, or whether they are more or less efficient than their counterparts elsewhere. A doctor sees a patient in clinic, and has her check into a McAllen hospital for a CT scan, an ultrasound, three rounds of blood tests, another ultrasound, and then surgery to have her gallbladder removed. How is Lawrence Gelman or Gilda Romero to know whether all that is essential, let alone the best possible treatment for the patient? It isnt what they are responsible or accountable for.


Health-care costs ultimately arise from the accumulation of individual decisions doctors make about which services and treatments to write an order for. The most expensive piece of medical equipment, as the saying goes, is a doctors pen. And, as a rule, hospital executives dont own the pen caps. Doctors do.

Hey Sisyphus when youve got a minute Id like to discuss this progress report with you.
Hey, Sisyphus, when youve got a minute Id like to discuss this progress report with you.
If doctors wield the pen, why do they do it so differently from one place to another? Brenda Sirovich, another Dartmouth researcher, published a study last year that provided an important clue. She and her team surveyed some eight hundred primary-care physicians from high-cost cities (such as Las Vegas and New York), low-cost cities (such as Sacramento and Boise), and others in between. The researchers asked the physicians specifically how they would handle a variety of patient cases. It turned out that differences in decision-making emerged in only some kinds of cases. In situations in which the right thing to do was well establishedfor example, whether to recommend a mammogram for a fifty-year-old woman (the answer is yes)physicians in high- and low-cost cities made the same decisions. But, in cases in which the science was unclear, some physicians pursued the maximum possible amount of testing and procedures; some pursued the minimum. And which kind of doctor they were depended on where they came from.

Sirovich asked doctors how they would treat a seventy-five-year-old woman with typical heartburn symptoms and adequate health insurance to cover tests and medications. Physicians in high- and low-cost cities were equally likely to prescribe antacid therapy and to check for H. pylori, an ulcer-causing bacteriumsteps strongly recommended by national guidelines. But when it came to measures of less certain valueand higher costthe differences were considerable. More than seventy per cent of physicians in high-cost cities referred the patient to a gastroenterologist, ordered an upper endoscopy, or both, while half as many in low-cost cities did. Physicians from high-cost cities typically recommended that patients with well-controlled hypertension see them in the office every one to three months, while those from low-cost cities recommended visits twice yearly. In case after uncertain case, more was not necessarily better. But physicians from the most expensive cities did the most expensive things.

Why? Some of it could reflect differences in training. I remember when my wife brought our infant son Walker to visit his grandparents in Virginia, and he took a terrifying fall down a set of stairs. They drove him to the local community hospital in Alexandria. A CT scan showed that he had a tiny subdural hematomaa small area of bleeding in the brain. During ten hours of observation, though, he was fineeating, drinking, completely alert. I was a surgery resident then and had seen many cases like his. We observed each child in intensive care for at least twenty-four hours and got a repeat CT scan. That was how Id been trained. But the doctor in Alexandria was going to send Walker home. That was how hed been trained. Suppose things change for the worse? I asked him. Its extremely unlikely, he said, and if anything changed Walker could always be brought back. I bullied the doctor into admitting him anyway. The next day, the scan and the patient were fine. And, looking in the textbooks, I learned that the doctor was right. Walker could have been managed safely either way.

There was no sign, however, that McAllens doctors as a group were trained any differently from El Pasos. One morning, I met with a hospital administrator who had extensive experience managing for-profit hospitals along the border. He offered a different possible explanation: the culture of money.

In El Paso, if you took a random doctor and looked at his tax returns eighty-five per cent of his income would come from the usual practice of medicine, he said. But in McAllen, the administrator thought, that percentage would be a lot less.

He knew of doctors who owned strip malls, orange groves, apartment complexesor imaging centers, surgery centers, or another part of the hospital they directed patients to. They had entrepreneurial spirit, he said. They were innovative and aggressive in finding ways to increase revenues from patient care. Theres no lack of work ethic, he said. But he had often seen financial considerations drive the decisions doctors made for patientsthe tests they ordered, the doctors and hospitals they recommendedand it bothered him. Several doctors who were unhappy about the direction medicine had taken in McAllen told me the same thing. Its a machine, my friend, one surgeon explained.

No one teaches you how to think about money in medical school or residency. Yet, from the moment you start practicing, you must think about it. You must consider what is covered for a patient and what is not. You must pay attention to insurance rejections and government-reimbursement rules. You must think about having enough money for the secretary and the nurse and the rent and the malpractice insurance.

Beyond the basics, however, many physicians are remarkably oblivious to the financial implications of their decisions. They see their patients. They make their recommendations. They send out the bills. And, as long as the numbers come out all right at the end of each month, they put the money out of their minds.

Others think of the money as a means of improving what they do. They think about how to use the insurance money to maybe install electronic health records with colleagues, or provide easier phone and e-mail access, or offer expanded hours. They hire an extra nurse to monitor diabetic patients more closely, and to make sure that patients dont miss their mammograms and pap smears and colonoscopies.

Then there are the physicians who see their practice primarily as a revenue stream. They instruct their secretary to have patients who call with follow-up questions schedule an appointment, because insurers dont pay for phone calls, only office visits. They consider providing Botox injections for cash. They take a Doppler ultrasound course, buy a machine, and start doing their patients scans themselves, so that the insurance payments go to them rather than to the hospital. They figure out ways to increase their high-margin work and decrease their low-margin work. This is a business, after all.

In every community, youll find a mixture of these views among physicians, but one or another tends to predominate. McAllen seems simply to be the community at one extreme.

In a few cases, the hospital executive told me, hed seen the behavior cross over into what seemed like outright fraud. Ive had doctors here come up to me and say, You want me to admit patients to your hospital, youre going to have to pay me. 

How much? I asked.

The amountsall of them were over a hundred thousand dollars per year, he said. The doctors were specific. The most he was asked for was five hundred thousand dollars per year.

He didnt pay any of them, he said: I mean, I gotta sleep at night. And he emphasized that these were just a handful of doctors. But he had never been asked for a kickback before coming to McAllen.

Woody Powell is a Stanford sociologist who studies the economic culture of cities. Recently, he and his research team studied why certain regionsBoston, San Francisco, San Diegobecame leaders in biotechnology while others with a similar concentration of scientific and corporate talentLos Angeles, Philadelphia, New Yorkdid not. The answer they found was what Powell describes as the anchor-tenant theory of economic development. Just as an anchor store will define the character of a mall, anchor tenants in biotechnology, whether its a company like Genentech, in South San Francisco, or a university like M.I.T., in Cambridge, define the character of an economic community. They set the norms. The anchor tenants that set norms encouraging the free flow of ideas and collaboration, even with competitors, produced enduringly successful communities, while those that mainly sought to dominate did not.


Powell suspects that anchor tenants play a similarly powerful community role in other areas of economics, too, and health care may be no exception. I spoke to a marketing rep for a McAllen home-health agency who told me of a process uncannily similar to what Powell found in biotech. Her job is to persuade doctors to use her agency rather than others. The competition is fierce. I opened the phone book and found seventeen pages of listings for home-health agenciestwo hundred and sixty in all. A patient typically brings in between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred dollars, and double that amount for specialized care. She described how, a decade or so ago, a few early agencies began rewarding doctors who ordered home visits with more than trinkets: they provided tickets to professional sporting events, jewelry, and other gifts. That set the tone. Other agencies jumped in. Some began paying doctors a supplemental salary, as medical directors, for steering business in their direction. Doctors came to expect a share of the revenue stream.

Agencies that want to compete on quality struggle to remain in business, the rep said. Doctors have asked her for a medical-director salary of four or five thousand dollars a month in return for sending her business. One asked a colleague of hers for private-school tuition for his child; another wanted sex.

I explained the rules and regulations and the anti-kickback law, and told them no, she said of her dealings with such doctors. Does it hurt my business? She paused. Im O.K. working only with ethical physicians, she finally said.

About fifteen years ago, it seems, something began to change in McAllen. A few leaders of local institutions took profit growth to be a legitimate ethic in the practice of medicine. Not all the doctors accepted this. But they failed to discourage those who did. So here, along the banks of the Rio Grande, in the Square Dance Capital of the World, a medical community came to treat patients the way subprime-mortgage lenders treated home buyers: as profit centers.

The real puzzle of American health care, I realized on the airplane home, is not why McAllen is different from El Paso. Its why El Paso isnt like McAllen. Every incentive in the system is an invitation to go the way McAllen has gone. Yet, across the country, large numbers of communities have managed to control their health costs rather than ratchet them up.

I talked to Denis Cortese, the C.E.O. of the Mayo Clinic, which is among the highest-quality, lowest-cost health-care systems in the country. A couple of years ago, I spent several days there as a visiting surgeon. Among the things that stand out from that visit was how much time the doctors spent with patients. There was no churnno shuttling patients in and out of rooms while the doctor bounces from one to the other. I accompanied a colleague while he saw patients. Most of the patients, like those in my clinic, required about twenty minutes. But one patient had colon cancer and a number of other complex issues, including heart disease. The physician spent an hour with her, sorting things out. He phoned a cardiologist with a question.

Ill be there, the cardiologist said.

Fifteen minutes later, he was. They mulled over everything together. The cardiologist adjusted a medication, and said that no further testing was needed. He cleared the patient for surgery, and the operating room gave her a slot the next day.

The whole interaction was astonishing to me. Just having the cardiologist pop down to see the patient with the surgeon would be unimaginable at my hospital. The time required wouldnt pay. The time required just to organize the system wouldnt pay.

The core tenet of the Mayo Clinic is The needs of the patient come firstnot the convenience of the doctors, not their revenues. The doctors and nurses, and even the janitors, sat in meetings almost weekly, working on ideas to make the service and the care better, not to get more money out of patients. I asked Cortese how the Mayo Clinic made this possible.

Its not easy, he said. But decades ago Mayo recognized that the first thing it needed to do was eliminate the financial barriers. It pooled all the money the doctors and the hospital system received and began paying everyone a salary, so that the doctors goal in patient care couldnt be increasing their income. Mayo promoted leaders who focussed first on what was best for patients, and then on how to make this financially possible.

No one there actually intends to do fewer expensive scans and procedures than is done elsewhere in the country. The aim is to raise quality and to help doctors and other staff members work as a team. But, almost by happenstance, the result has been lower costs.

When doctors put their heads together in a room, when they share expertise, you get more thinking and less testing, Cortese told me.

Skeptics saw the Mayo model as a local phenomenon that wouldnt carry beyond the hay fields of northern Minnesota. But in 1986 the Mayo Clinic opened a campus in Florida, one of our most expensive states for health care, and, in 1987, another one in Arizona. It was difficult to recruit staff members who would accept a salary and the Mayos collaborative way of practicing. Leaders were working against the dominant medical culture and incentives. The expansion sites took at least a decade to get properly established. But eventually they achieved the same high-quality, low-cost results as Rochester. Indeed, Cortese says that the Florida site has become, in some respects, the most efficient one in the system.

The Mayo Clinic is not an aberration. One of the lowest-cost markets in the country is Grand Junction, Colorado, a community of a hundred and twenty thousand that nonetheless has achieved some of Medicares highest quality-of-care scores. Michael Pramenko is a family physician and a local medical leader there. Unlike doctors at the Mayo Clinic, he told me, those in Grand Junction get piecework fees from insurers. But years ago the doctors agreed among themselves to a system that paid them a similar fee whether they saw Medicare, Medicaid, or private-insurance patients, so that there would be little incentive to cherry-pick patients. They also agreed, at the behest of the main health plan in town, an H.M.O., to meet regularly on small peer-review committees to go over their patient charts together. They focussed on rooting out problems like poor prevention practices, unnecessary back operations, and unusual hospital-complication rates. Problems went down. Quality went up. Then, in 2004, the doctors group and the local H.M.O. jointly created a regional information networka community-wide electronic-record system that shared office notes, test results, and hospital data for patients across the area. Again, problems went down. Quality went up. And costs ended up lower than just about anywhere else in the United States.

Grand Junctions medical community was not following anyone elses recipe. But, like Mayo, it created what Elliott Fisher, of Dartmouth, calls an accountable-care organization. The leading doctors and the hospital system adopted measures to blunt harmful financial incentives, and they took collective responsibility for improving the sum total of patient care.

This approach has been adopted in other places, too: the Geisinger Health System, in Danville, Pennsylvania; the Marshfield Clinic, in Marshfield, Wisconsin; Intermountain Healthcare, in Salt Lake City; Kaiser Permanente, in Northern California. All of them function on similar principles. All are not-for-profit institutions. And all have produced enviably higher quality and lower costs than the average American town enjoys.

When you look across the spectrum from Grand Junction to McAllenand the almost threefold difference in the costs of careyou come to realize that we are witnessing a battle for the soul of American medicine. Somewhere in the United States at this moment, a patient with chest pain, or a tumor, or a cough is seeing a doctor. And the damning question we have to ask is whether the doctor is set up to meet the needs of the patient, first and foremost, or to maximize revenue.

There is no insurance system that will make the two aims match perfectly. But having a system that does so much to misalign them has proved disastrous. As economists have often pointed out, we pay doctors for quantity, not quality. As they point out less often, we also pay them as individuals, rather than as members of a team working together for their patients. Both practices have made for serious problems.

Providing health care is like building a house. The task requires experts, expensive equipment and materials, and a huge amount of cordination. Imagine that, instead of paying a contractor to pull a team together and keep them on track, you paid an electrician for every outlet he recommends, a plumber for every faucet, and a carpenter for every cabinet. Would you be surprised if you got a house with a thousand outlets, faucets, and cabinets, at three times the cost you expected, and the whole thing fell apart a couple of years later? Getting the countrys best electrician on the job (he trained at Harvard, somebody tells you) isnt going to solve this problem. Nor will changing the person who writes him the check.

This last point is vital. Activists and policymakers spend an inordinate amount of time arguing about whether the solution to high medical costs is to have government or private insurance companies write the checks. Heres how this whole debate goes. Advocates of a public option say government financing would save the most money by having leaner administrative costs and forcing doctors and hospitals to take lower payments than they get from private insurance. Opponents say doctors would skimp, quit, or game the system, and make us wait in line for our care; they maintain that private insurers are better at policing doctors. No, the skeptics say: all insurance companies do is reject applicants who need health care and stall on paying their bills. Then we have the economists who say that the people who should pay the doctors are the ones who use them. Have consumers pay with their own dollars, make sure that they have some skin in the game, and then theyll get the care they deserve. These arguments miss the main issue. When it comes to making care better and cheaper, changing who pays the doctor will make no more difference than changing who pays the electrician. The lesson of the high-quality, low-cost communities is that someone has to be accountable for the totality of care. Otherwise, you get a system that has no brakes. You get McAllen.

One afternoon in McAllen, I rode down McColl Road with Lester Dyke, the cardiac surgeon, and we passed a series of office plazas that seemed to be nothing but home-health agencies, imaging centers, and medical-equipment stores.

Medicine has become a pig trough here, he muttered.

Dyke is among the few vocal critics of whats happened in McAllen. We took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen, he said.

We began talking about the various proposals being touted in Washington to fix the cost problem. I asked him whether expanding public-insurance programs like Medicare and shrinking the role of insurance companies would do the trick in McAllen.

I dont have a problem with it, he said. But it wont make a difference. In McAllen, government payers already predominatenot many people have jobs with private insurance.

How about doing the opposite and increasing the role of big insurance companies?

What good would that do? Dyke asked.

The third class of health-cost proposals, I explained, would push people to use medical savings accounts and hold high-deductible insurance policies: Theyd have more of their own money on the line, and thatd drive them to bargain with you and other surgeons, right?

He gave me a quizzical look. We tried to imagine the scenario. A cardiologist tells an elderly woman that she needs bypass surgery and has Dr. Dyke see her. They discuss the blockages in her heart, the operation, the risks. And now theyre supposed to haggle over the price as if he were selling a rug in a souk? Ill do three vessels for thirty thousand, but if you take four Ill throw in an extra night in the I.C.U.that sort of thing? Dyke shook his head. Who comes up with this stuff? he asked. Any plan that relies on the sheep to negotiate with the wolves is doomed to failure.

Instead, McAllen and other cities like it have to be weaned away from their untenably fragmented, quantity-driven systems of health care, step by step. And that will mean rewarding doctors and hospitals if they band together to form Grand Junction-like accountable-care organizations, in which doctors collaborate to increase prevention and the quality of care, while discouraging overtreatment, undertreatment, and sheer profiteering. Under one approach, insurerswhether public or privatewould allow clinicians who formed such organizations and met quality goals to keep half the savings they generate. Government could also shift regulatory burdens, and even malpractice liability, from the doctors to the organization. Other, sterner, approaches would penalize those who dont form these organizations.

This will by necessity be an experiment. We will need to do in-depth research on what makes the best systems successfulthe peer-review committees? recruiting more primary-care doctors and nurses? putting doctors on salary?and disseminate what we learn. Congress has provided vital funding for research that compares the effectiveness of different treatments, and this should help reduce uncertainty about which treatments are best. But we also need to fund research that compares the effectiveness of different systems of careto reduce our uncertainty about which systems work best for communities. These are empirical, not ideological, questions. And we would do well to form a national institute for health-care delivery, bringing together clinicians, hospitals, insurers, employers, and citizens to assess, regularly, the quality and the cost of our care, review the strategies that produce good results, and make clear recommendations for local systems.

Dramatic improvements and savings will take at least a decade. But a choice must be made. Whom do we want in charge of managing the full complexity of medical care? We can turn to insurers (whether public or private), which have proved repeatedly that they cant do it. Or we can turn to the local medical communities, which have proved that they can. But we have to choose someonebecause, in much of the country, no one is in charge. And the result is the most wasteful and the least sustainable health-care system in the world.

Something even more worrisome is going on as well. In the war over the culture of medicinethe war over whether our countrys anchor model will be Mayo or McAllenthe Mayo model is losing. In the sharpest economic downturn that our health system has faced in half a century, many people in medicine dont see why they should do the hard work of organizing themselves in ways that reduce waste and improve quality if it means sacrificing revenue.

In El Paso, the for-profit health-care executive told me, a few leading physicians recently followed McAllens lead and opened their own centers for surgery and imaging. When I was in Tulsa a few months ago, a fellow-surgeon explained how he had made up for lost revenue by shifting his operations for well-insured patients to a specialty hospital that he partially owned while keeping his poor and uninsured patients at a nonprofit hospital in town. Even in Grand Junction, Michael Pramenko told me, some of the doctors are beginning to complain about leaving money on the table. 

As America struggles to extend health-care coverage while curbing health-care costs, we face a decision that is more important than whether we have a public-insurance option, more important than whether we will have a single-payer system in the long run or a mixture of public and private insurance, as we do now. The decision is whether we are going to reward the leaders who are trying to build a new generation of Mayos and Grand Junctions. If we dont, McAllen wont be an outlier. It will be our future. "
