No one has lived on this farm for years. The barn looks empty. But it isn't! Strange creatures are sleeping in the loft. As the sun goes down, they take to the air. There is one thing that makes bats different from other mammals. They can fly. Bat wings are not like bird wings. Bats do not have feathers. A bat's wing is really an arm with a hand. Its long, thin fingers are joined by a flap of skin. Bats even have little thumbs. Many people think that bats are blind. But that's not true. Bats have eyes and they can see. It's just that they spend most of the time in the dark. From far away the creatures lool like birds. But who ever heard of a bird with fur? Close up, they look like mice. But who ever heard of a mouse with wings?
