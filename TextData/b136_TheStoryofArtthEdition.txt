In one of his letters to a young painter, Cézanne had advised him to look at nature in terms of spheres, cones and
cylinders. He presumably meant that he should always keep these basic solid shapes in mind when organizing his
pictures. But Picasso and his friends decided to take this advice literally. I suppose that they reasoned somewhat like
this: ‘We have long given up claiming that we represent things as they appear to our eyes. That was a will-o’-the-wisp
which it is useless to pursue. We do not want to fix on the canvas the imaginary impression of a fleeting moment.
Let us follow Cézanne’s example, and build up the picture of our motifs as solidly and enduringly as we can. Why not
be consistent and accept the fact that our real aim is rather to construct something, rather than to copy something?
If we think of an object, let us say a violin, it does not appear before the eye of our mind the way it would appear
before our bodily eyes. We can, and in fact do, think of its various aspects at the same time. Some of them stand out
so clearly that we feel we can touch them and handle them; others are somehow blurred. And this strange medley of
images represents more of the “real” violin than any single snapshot or meticulous painting could ever contain.’ This,
I suppose, was the reasoning which led to such paintings as Picasso’s still life of a violin, figure 374. In some respects,
it represents a return to what we have called Egyptian principles, in which an object was drawn from the angle from
which its characteristic form came out most clearly.
