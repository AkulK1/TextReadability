Cowgirl Kate rode her horse, Cocoa, out to the pasture. “It’s time to herd cows,” said Cowgirl Kate. “I am thirsty,” said Cocoa. He stopped at the creek and took a drink. “Are you ready now?” asked Cowgirl Kate. “No,” said Cocoa. “Now I am hungry.” Cowgirl Kate gave him an apple. He ate it in one bite. Then he sniffed the saddlebag. Cowgirl Kate gave him another apple. He ate that in one bite, too. He sniffed the saddlebag again. “You are a pig,” said Cowgirl Kate. “No,” said Cocoa. “I am a horse.” “A cowhorse?” she asked. “Of course,” he said. “But a cowhorse herds cows,” she said. “Just now, I am too full,” he said. Cowgirl Kate smiled. “Then I will tell you a story.” “Once there was a cowgirl who needed a cowhorse. She went to a ranch and saw lots and lots of horses. Then she saw a horse whose coat was the color of chocolate. His tail and mane were the color of caramel. ‘Yum,’ said the cowgirl, ‘you are the colors of my favorite candy.’ The horse looked at her. He sniffed her.” “’Are you a real cowgirl?’ he asked. ‘I am a cowgirl from the boots up,’ she said. ‘Well, I am a cowhorse from the mane down,’ he said. ‘Will you work hard every day?’ the cowgirl asked.. The horse raised his head high. ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘a cowhorse always does his job.’ ‘At last,’ said the cowgirl, ‘I have found my horse.’” “That was a good story,” said Cocoa. He raised his head high. “And now I am ready to herd cows.”
