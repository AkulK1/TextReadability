A medieval fisherman is said to have hauled up a three-foot-long cod, which was
common enough at the time. And the fact that the cod could talk was not especially
surprising. But what was astonishing was that it spoke an unknown language. It spoke
Basque.
This Basque folktale shows not only the Basque attachment to their orphan language,
indecipherable to the rest of the world, but also their tie to the Atlantic cod, Gadus
morhua, a fish that has never been found in Basque or even Spanish waters.
The Basques are enigmatic. They have lived in what is now the northwest corner of
Spain and a nick of the French southwest for longer than history records, and not only is
the origin of their language unknown, but also the origin of the people themselves
remains a mystery also. According to one theory, these rosy-cheeked, dark-haired,
long-nosed people were the original Iberians, driven by invaders to this mountainous
corner between the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian Sierra, and the Bay of Biscay. Or they
may be indigenous to this area.
They graze sheep on impossibly steep, green slopes of mountains that are thrilling in
their rare, rugged beauty. They sing their own songs and write their own literature in
their own language, Euskera. Possibly Europe’s oldest living language, Euskera is one
of only four European languages—along with Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian—not in
the Indo-European family.
