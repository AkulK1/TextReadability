There was music from my neighbor’s house through the
summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came
and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched
his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the
sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an
omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between
nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all
trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra
gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes
and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of
the night before.
Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived
from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same
oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could
extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if
a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s
thumb.
At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down
with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored 
44 The Great Gatsby
lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous
garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening horsd’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of
harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to
a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was
set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials
so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too
young to know one from another.
By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and
saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and
high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach
now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are
parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair
shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams
of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of
cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive
with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings
between women who never knew each other’s names.
The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from
the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail
music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter
is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped
out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same
breath—already there are wanderers, confident girls who
weave here and there among the stouter and more stable,

become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group
and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and color under the constantly
changing light.
Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a
cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas
platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies
his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter
as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s
understudy from the ‘Follies.’ The party has begun.
I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house
I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there. They got into
automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were
introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that
they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they
came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for
the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket
of admission.
I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of
robin’s egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer—the
honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend
his ‘little party’ that night. He had seen me several times
and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar
combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay 
46 The Great Gatsby
Gatsby in a majestic hand.
Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a
little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease
among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though
here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young
Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and
prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling
something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were,
at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the
right key.
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host
but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so
vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk
off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in
the garden where a single man could linger without looking
purposeless and alone.
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and
stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into
the garden.
Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to
someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks
to the passers-by.
‘Hello!’ I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 47
unnaturally loud across the garden.
‘I thought you might be here,’ she responded absently as I
came up. ‘I remembered you lived next door to——‘
She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d
take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin
yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.
‘Hello!’ they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t win.’
That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.
‘You don’t know who we are,’ said one of the girls in yellow, ‘but we met you here about a month ago.’
‘You’ve dyed your hair since then,’ remarked Jordan, and
I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like
the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s
slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps
and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated
at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with
the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced
to us as Mr. Mumble.
‘Do you come to these parties often?’ inquired Jordan of
the girl beside her.
‘The last one was the one I met you at,’ answered the girl,
in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion:
‘Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?’
It was for Lucille, too.
‘I like to come,’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what I do, so
I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my
gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—
48 The Great Gatsby
inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new
evening gown in it.’
‘Did you keep it?’ asked Jordan.
‘Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too
big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with
lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.’
‘There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing
like that,’ said the other girl eagerly. ‘He doesn’t want any
trouble with ANYbody.’
‘Who doesn’t?’ I inquired.
‘Gatsby. Somebody told me——‘
The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.’
A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles
bent forward and listened eagerly.
‘I don’t think it’s so much THAT,’ argued Lucille skeptically; ‘it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.’
One of the men nodded in confirmation.
‘I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew
up with him in Germany,’ he assured us positively.
‘Oh, no,’ said the first girl, ‘it couldn’t be that, because he
was in the American army during the war.’ As our credulity
switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.
‘You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.’
She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered.
We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were
whispers about him from those who found little that it was 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 49
necessary to whisper about in this world.
The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join
her own party who were spread around a table on the other
side of the garden. There were three married couples and
Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent
innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner
or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the
function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully
on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.
‘Let’s get out,’ whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. ‘This is much too polite for
me.’
We got up, and she explained that we were going to find
the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making
me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.
The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby
was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the
steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried
an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably
transported complete from some ruin overseas.
A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great
table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of 
50 The Great Gatsby
books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.
‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously.
‘About what?’
He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.’
‘The books?’
He nodded.
‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought
they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re
absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.’
Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the
bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‘Stoddard
Lectures.’
‘See!’ he cried triumphantly. ‘It’s a bona fide piece of
printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco.
It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew
when to stop too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you
want? What do you expect?’
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on
its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole
library was liable to collapse.
‘Who brought you?’ he demanded. ‘Or did you just come?
I was brought. Most people were brought.’
Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.
‘I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,’ he continued. ‘Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 51
somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now,
and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’
‘Has it?’
‘A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an
hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—
—‘
‘You told us.’
We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.
There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden,
old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously,
fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving
the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated
tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung
in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’
all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter
rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage ‘twins’—who
turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than
finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the
Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the
stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.
I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table
with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave
way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls 
52 The Great Gatsby
of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes
into something significant, elemental and profound.
At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and
smiled.
‘Your face is familiar,’ he said, politely. ‘Weren’t you in
the Third Division during the war?’
‘Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’
‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’
We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told
me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to
try it out in the morning.
‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along
the Sound.’
‘What time?’
‘Any time that suits you best.’
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
‘Having a gay time now?’ she inquired.
‘Much better.’ I turned again to my new acquaintance.
‘This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the
host. I live over there——’ I waved my hand at the invisible
hedge in the distance, ‘and this man Gatsby sent over his
chauffeur with an invitation.’
For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said suddenly.
‘What!’ I exclaimed. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 53
‘I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very
good host.’
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of
eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or
five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU
with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood
you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed
in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured
you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your
best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a
year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech
just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced
himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.
Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that
Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself
with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,’ he urged
me. ‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.’
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—
constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected
that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in
his middle years.
‘Who is he?’ I demanded. ‘Do you know?’
‘He’s just a man named Gatsby.’
54 The Great Gatsby
‘Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?’
‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with
a wan smile. ‘Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford
man.’
A dim background started to take shape behind him but
at her next remark it faded away.
‘However, I don’t believe it.’
‘Why not?’
‘I don’t know,’ she insisted, ‘I just don’t think he went
there.’
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I
think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my
curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana
or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial
inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
‘Anyhow he gives large parties,’ said Jordan, changing
the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‘And I
like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there
isn’t any privacy.’
There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the
orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of
the garden.
‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he cried. ‘At the request of Mr.
Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s
latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie
Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 55
a big sensation.’ He smiled with jovial condescension and
added ‘Some sensation!’ whereupon everybody laughed.
‘The piece is known,’ he concluded lustily, ‘as ‘Vladimir
Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.’ ‘
The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone
on the marble steps and looking from one group to another
with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it
were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped
to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he
grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When
the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting
their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial
way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s
arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby
and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
‘I beg your pardon.’
Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.
‘Miss Baker?’ he inquired. ‘I beg your pardon but Mr.
Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.’
‘With me?’ she exclaimed in surprise.
‘Yes, madame.’
She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed
that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports 
56 The Great Gatsby
clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if
she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean,
crisp mornings.
I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused
and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s
undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to
join him, I went inside.
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in
yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall,
red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in
song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during
the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was
weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she
filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down
her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into
contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an
inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black
rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the
notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank
into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’
explained a girl at my elbow.
I looked around. Most of the remaining women were
now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even
Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asun-
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 57
der by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious
intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent
way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at
intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry
diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear.
The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward
men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were
sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.
‘Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to
go home.’
‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.’
‘We’re always the first ones to leave.’
‘So are we.’
‘Well, we’re almost the last tonight,’ said one of the men
sheepishly. ‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.’
In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence
was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.
As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library
opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.
He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his
manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people
approached him to say goodbye.
Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the
porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.
‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered.
‘How long were we in there?’
58 The Great Gatsby
‘Why,—about an hour.’
‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly. ‘But
I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.’ She
yawned gracefully in my face. ‘Please come and see me….
Phone book…. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard…. My aunt….’ She was hurrying off as she talked—her
brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
party at the door.
Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed
so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for
him early in the evening and to apologize for not having
known him in the garden.
‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly. ‘Don’t give it
another thought, old sport.’ The familiar expression held no
more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed
my shoulder. ‘And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’
Then the butler, behind his shoulder:
‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.’
‘All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there….
good night.’
‘Good night.’
‘Good night.’ He smiled—and suddenly there seemed
to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last
to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ‘Good night, old
sport…. Good night.’
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was
not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights 
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 59
illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel,
rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two
minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable
attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as
they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant
din from those in the rear had been audible for some time
and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck
and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the
car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.
‘See!’ he explained. ‘It went in the ditch.’
The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the
man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.
‘How’d it happen?’
He shrugged his shoulders.
‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said decisively.
‘But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?’
‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the
whole matter. ‘I know very little about driving—next to
nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.’
‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving
at night.’
‘But I wasn’t even trying,’ he explained indignantly, ‘I
wasn’t even trying.’
60 The Great Gatsby
An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.
‘Do you want to commit suicide?’
‘You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not
even TRYing!’
‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal. ‘I wasn’t
driving. There’s another man in the car.’
The shock that followed this declaration found voice in
a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coupé swung slowly
open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was
a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale
dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.
Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by
the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood
swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the
duster.
‘Wha’s matter?’ he inquired calmly. ‘Did we run outa
gas?’
‘Look!’
Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he
stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though
he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.
‘It came off,’ some one explained.
He nodded.
‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.’
A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening
his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:
‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’
Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com 61
At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than
he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer
joined by any physical bond.
‘Back out,’ he suggested after a moment. ‘Put her in reverse.’
‘But the WHEEL’S off!’
He hesitated.
‘No harm in trying,’ he said.
The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I
turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced
back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s
house, making the night fine as before and surviving the
laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and
the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a
formal gesture of farewell.
Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given
the impression that the events of three nights several weeks
apart were all that absorbed me.
