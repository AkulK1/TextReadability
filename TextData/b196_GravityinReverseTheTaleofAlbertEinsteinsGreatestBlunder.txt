Cosmology has always been weird. Worlds resting on the backs of turtles, matter and energy coming into existence
out of much less than thin air. And now, just when you’d gotten familiar, if hot really comfortable, with the idea of a
big bang, along comes something new to worry about. A mysterious and universal pressure pervades all of space and
acts against the cosmic gravity that has tried to drag the universe back together ever since the big bang. On top of
that, “negative gravity” has forced the expansion of the universe to accelerate exponentially, and cosmic gravity is
losing the tug-of-war.
For these and similarly mind-warping ideas in twentieth-century physics, just blame Albert Einstein.
Einstein hardly ever set foot in the laboratory; he didn’t test phenomena or use elaborate equipment. He was a theorist who perfected the “thought experiment,” in which you engage nature through your imagination, inventing a situation or a model and then working out the consequences of some physical principle.
If—as was the case for Einstein—a physicist’s model is intended to represent the entire universe, then manipulating
the model should be tantamount to manipulating the universe itself. Observers and experimentalists can then go out
and look for the phenomena predicted by that model. If the model is flawed, or if the theorists make a mistake in their 
calculations, the observers will detect a mismatch between the model’s predictions and the way things happen in the
real universe. That’s the first cue to try again, either by adjusting the old model or by creating a new one.
