On June 8, 1654. Tennis Tomasen was again in court, demanding 13 florins from Michael Paulisen. for whom he had built a chimney according to contract. The chimney smoked and Paulisen had had it pulled down and rebuilt by someone else, at a cost of two beavers. He said he did not owe the debt. The court decided in favor of Tomasen: since defendant Paulisen "at his own pleasure had the chimney taken down and rebuilt, plaintiff cannot be prejudiced thereby." Many of these early chimneys were wooden, above thatched reed roofs. Fire was a constant danger to the town. If a house burned down due to the negligence of the owner, he was fined 25 guilders. Four firewarders were appointed to inspect all chimneys: an unclean one was fined three guilders. with the money used to maintain the town's fire ladders. hooks, and leather water buckets. Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his council, In 1647. ordered people who had been granted lots to put up proper buildings on them, or the lots would be taken from them and given to people who wanted to build and were in need of a proper place. All sales of real estate had to be approved by the authorities to prevent fraud. Moreover, in 1655 a commission of four surveyed the entire town. with orders to straighten out streets and fix the location of lots. They not only laid out seventeen streets, they surveyed and fixed prices for the lots.
