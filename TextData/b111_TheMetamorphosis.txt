When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin. He was lying on his back as hard as armor plate, and when he lifted his head a little, he saw his vaulted
brown belly, sectioned by arch-shaped ribs, to whose dome the cover, about to slide off completely, could barely
cling. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, were waving helplessly before his eyes.
“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small
side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all
spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine
and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up
against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.
Gregor’s eyes then turned to the window, and the overcast weather--he could hear raindrops hitting against the
metal window ledge--completely depressed him. “How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting
all this nonsense,” he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side
and in his present state could not get into that position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he
always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his
squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.
