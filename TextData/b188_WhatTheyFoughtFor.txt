One of the questions often asked a Civil War historian is, “Why did the North fight?” Southern motives seem easier
to understand. Confederates fought for independence, for their own property and way of life, for their very survival
as a nation. But what did the Yankees fight for? Why did they persist through four years of the bloodiest conflict in
American history, costing 360,000 northern lives—not to mention 260,000 southern lives and untold destruction of
resources? Puzzling over this question in 1863, Confederate War Department clerk John Jones wrote in his diary: “Our
men must prevail in combat, or lose their property, country, freedom, everything…. On the other hand the enemy, in
yielding the contest, may retire into their own country, and possess everything they enjoyed before the war began.”
If that was true, why did the Yankees keep fighting? We can find much of the answer in Abraham Lincoln’s notable
speeches: the Gettysburg Address, his first and second inaugural addresses, the peroration of his message to Congress on December 1, 1862. But we can find even more of the answer in the wartime letters and diaries of the men
who did the fighting. Confederates who said that they fought for the same goals as their forebears of 1776 would
have been surprised by the intense conviction of the northern soldiers that they were upholding the legacy of the
American Revolution.
