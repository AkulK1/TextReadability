That night in my rented room, while letting the hot water run over my can of pork and beans in the sink, I opened
A Book of Prefaces and began to read. I was jarred and shocked by the style, the clear, clean, sweeping sentences.
Why did he write like that? And how did one write like that? I pictured the man as a raging demon, slashing with his
pen, consumed with hate, denouncing everything American, extolling everything European or German, laughing at
the weakness of people, mocking God, authority. What was this? I stood up, trying to realize what reality lay behind
the meaning of the wordsâ€¦Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using
them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons? Well, yes, for here they were. Then maybe, perhaps, I could
use them as a weapon? No. It frightened me. I read on and what amazed me was not what he said, but how on earth
anybody had the courage to say it.
Occasionally I glance up to reassure myself that I was alone in the room. Who were these men about whom Mencken
was talking so passionately? Who was Anatole France? Joseph Conrad? Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, Dostoevski, George Moore, Gustave Flaubert, Maupassant, Tolstoy, Frank Harris, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy, Arnold Bennett, Stephen Crane, Zola, Norris, Gorky, Bergson, Ibsen, Balzac, Bernard Shaw, Dumas, Poe, Thomas Mann, O. Henry,
Dreiser, H.G. Wells, Gogol, T.S. Eliot, Gide, Baudelaire, Edgar Lee masters, Stendhal, Turgenev, Huneker, Nietzsche, and
scores of others? Were these men real? Did they exist or had they existed? And how did one pronounce their names?
