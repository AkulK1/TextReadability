George Washington Carver was born in Missouri in 1860-more than a hundred years ago. It was a terrible time. Mean men rode silently in the night, kidnapping slaves form their owners and harming those who tried to stop them. One night, a band of these men rode up to the farm of Moses Carver, who owned George and his mother, Mary. Everyone ran in fear. But before Mary could hide her baby, the men cam and snatched them both, and rode away into the night. Moses Carver sent a man to look for them. Mary was never found. But in a few days, the man returned with a small bundle wrapped in his coat and tied to the back of his saffle. It was the baby, George. George was not discouraged. He moved to Iowa and found a college which was glad to have a black student. At college, George continued to work. He opened a laundry where he washed his schoolmates' clothes. And, he continued to learn. His teachers and friends soon realized that this earnest young man was bursting with talents. He played the piano, he sang beautifully, and he was an outstanding painter. In fact, for a time he thought of becoming an artist.
