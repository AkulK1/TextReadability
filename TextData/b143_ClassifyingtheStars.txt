Sunlight and starlight are composed of waves of various lengths, which the eye, even aided by a telescope, is unable
to separate. We must use more than a telescope. In order to sort out the component colors, the light must be dispersed by a prism, or split up by some other means. For instance, sunbeams passing through rain drops, are transformed into the myriad-tinted rainbow. The familiar rainbow spanning the sky is Nature’s most glorious demonstration
that light is composed of many colors.
The very beginning of our knowledge of the nature of a star dates back to 1672, when Isaac Newton gave to the world
the results of his experiments on passing sunlight through a prism. To describe the beautiful band of rainbow tints,
produced when sunlight was dispersed by his three-cornered piece of glass, he took from the Latin the word spectrum, meaning an appearance. The rainbow is the spectrum of the Sun.
In 1814, more than a century after Newton, the spectrum of the Sun was obtained in such purity that an amazing
detail was seen and studied by the German optician, Fraunhofer. He saw that the multiple spectral tings, ranging from
delicate violet to deep red, were crossed by hundreds of fine dark lines. In other words, there were narrow gaps in the
spectrum where certain shades were wholly blotted out.
We must remember that the word spectrum is applied not only to sunlight, but also to the light of any glowing substance when its rays are sorted out by a prism or a grating.
