Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final
resting-place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this.
But in a large sense we cannot dedicate,—we cannot consecrate,—we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will little
note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is, rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that
cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that Government of the people,
by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
