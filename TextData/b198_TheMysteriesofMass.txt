Physicists are hunting for an elusive particle that would reveal the presence of a new kind of field that permeates all
of reality. Finding that Higgs field will give us a more complete understanding about how the universe works.
Most people think they know what mass is, but they understand only part of the story. For instance, an elephant is
clearly bulkier and weighs more than an ant. Even in the absence of gravity, the elephant would have greater mass—it
would be harder to push and set in motion. Obviously the elephant is more massive because it is made of many more
atoms than the ant is, but what determines the masses of the individual atoms? What about the elementary particles
that make up the atoms—what determines their masses? Indeed, why do they even have mass?
We see that the problem of mass has two independent aspects. First, we need to learn how mass arises at all. It turns
out mass results from at least three different mechanisms, which I will describe below. A key player in physicists’
tentative theories about mass is a new kind of field that permeates all of reality, called the Higgs field. Elementary
particle masses are thought to come about from the interaction with the Higgs field. If the Higgs field exists, theory
demands that it have an associated particle, the Higgs boson. Using particle accelerators, scientists are now hunting
for the Higgs.
