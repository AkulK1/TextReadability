The decade following establishment of the “permanent Indian frontier” was a bad time for the eastern tribes. The
great Cherokee nation had survived more than a hundred years of the white man’s wars, diseases, and whiskey, but
now it was to be blotted out. Because the Cherokees numbered several thousands, their removal to the West was
planned to be in gradual stages, but the discovery of Appalachian gold within their territory brought on a clamor for
their immediate wholesale exodus. During the autumn of 1838, General Winfield Scott’s soldiers rounded them up and
concentrated them into camps. (A few hundred escaped to the Smoky Mountains and many years later where given
a small reservation in North Carolina.) From the prison camps they were started westward to Indian Territory. On the
long winter trek, one of every four Cherokees died from the cold, hunger, or disease. They called the march their “trail
of tears.” The Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles also gave up their homelands in the South. In the North,
surviving remnants of the Shawnees, Miamis, Ottawas, Hurons, Delawares, and many other once mighty tribes walked
or traveled by horseback and wagon beyond the Mississippi, carrying their shabby goods, their rusty farming tools,
and bags of seed corn. All of them arrived as refugees, poor relations, in the country of the proud and free Plains
Indians.
Scarcely were the refugees settled behind the security of the “permanent Indian frontier” when soldiers began marching westward through Indian country. The white men of the United States—who talked so much of peace but rarely
seemed to practice it—were marching to war with the white men who had conquered the Indians of Mexico. When the
war with Mexico ended in 1847, the United States took possession of a vast expanse of territory reaching from Texas
to California. All of it was west of the “permanent Indian frontier.”
