Abuela gives me a box of letters she wrote to her onetime lover in Spain, but never sent. She shows me his photograph, too. It’s very well preserved. He’d be good-looking by today’s standards, well built with a full beard and kind
eyes, almost professorial. He wore a crisp linen suit and a boater tilted slightly to the left. Abuela tells me she took the
picture herself one Sunday on the Malecón,
She also gives me a book of poems she’s had since 1930, we she heard García Lorca read at the Principal de la Comedia Theater. Abuela knows each poem by heart, and recites them quite dramatically.
I’ve started dreaming in Spanish, which has never happened before. I wake up feeling different, like something inside
me is changing, something chemical and irreversible. There’s a magic here working its way through my veins. There’s
something about the vegetation, too, that I respond to instinctively—the stunning bougainvillea, the flamboyants and
jacarandas, the orchids growing from the trunks of the mysterious ceiba trees. And I love Havana, its noise and decay
and painted ladyness. I could happily sit on one of those wrought-iron balconies for days, or keep my grandmother
company on her porch, with its ringside view of the sea. I’m afraid to lose all this. To lose Abuela Celia again. But I
know that sooner or later I’d have to return to New York.
