There once was a man and his name was Isaac. He lived in such poverty that again and again he went to bed hungry. One night, he had a dream. In his dream, a voice told him to go to the capital city and look for a treasure under the bridge by the Royal Palace. "It is only a dream," he thought when he woke up, and he paid no attention to it. Isaac told him the dream. The captain laughed. "You poor fellow," he said, "what a pity you wore your shoes out for a dream." Listen if I believed a dream I once had, I would go right now to the city you came from, and I'd look for a treasure under the stove in the house of a fello named Isaac." And he laughed again.
