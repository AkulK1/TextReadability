It was a very snowy day and Poppleton felt like a sleigh ride. He called his friend Cherry Sue. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry, Poppleton, I’m making cookies,” said Cherry Sue. Poppleton called his friend Hudson. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry,” said Hudson, “I’m baking a cake.” Poppleton called his friend Fillmore. “Would you like to go for a sleigh ride?” Poppleton asked. “Sorry,” said Fillmore. “I’m stirring some fudge.” Poppleton was disappointed. He couldn’t find one friend for a sleigh ride. And besides that, they were all making such good things to eat! He sat in front of his window, feeling very sorry for himself. Suddenly the doorbell rang. “SURPRISE!” There stood all of Poppleton’s friends! With cookies and cake and fudge and presents! “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, POPPLETON!” He had forgotten his own birthday! Everyone ate and laughed and played games with Poppleton. Then, just before midnight, they all took him on a sleigh ride. The moon was full and white. The stars twinkled. The owls hooted in the trees. Over the snow went the sleigh filled with Poppleton and all of his friends. Poppleton didn’t even make a birthday wish. He had everything already.
