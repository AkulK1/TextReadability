“. . . have no doubt,” Fremantle was saying, “that General Lee shall become the world’s foremost authority on military
matters when this war is over, which would appear now to be only a matter of days, or at most a few weeks. I suspect
all Europe will be turning to him for lessons.”
Lessons?
“I have been thinking, I must confess, of setting some brief thoughts to paper,” Fremantle announced gravely. “Some
brief remarks of my own, appended to an account of this battle, and perhaps others this army has fought. Some notes
as to tactics.”
Tactics?
“General Lee’s various stratagems will be most instructive, most illuminating. I wonder, sir, if I might enlist your aid in
this, ah, endeavor. As one most closely concerned? That is, to be brief, may I come to you when in need?”
“Sure,” Longstreet said. Tactics? He chuckled. The tactics were simple: find the enemy, fight him. He shook his head,
snorting. Fremantle spoke softly, in tones of awe.
“One would not think of General Lee, now that one has met him, now that one has looked him, so to speak, in the eye,

“Devious?” Longstreet swung to stare at him, aghast.
“Oh my word,” Fremantle went on devoutly, “but he’s a tricky one. The Old Gray Fox, as they say. Charming phrase.
American to the hilt.”
“Devious?” Longstreet stopped dead in the road. “Devious.” He laughed aloud. Fremantle stared an owlish stare.
“Why, Colonel, bless your soul, there ain’t a devious bone in Robert Lee’s body, don’t you know that?”
