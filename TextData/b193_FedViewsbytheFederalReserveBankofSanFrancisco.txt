Mary C. Daly, vice president and director of the Center for the Study of Innovation and Productivity at the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, states her views on the current economy and the outlook.
Financial markets are improving, and the crisis mode that has characterized the past year is subsiding. The
adverse feedback loop, in which losses by banks and other lenders lead to tighter credit availability, which
then leads to lower spending by households and businesses, has begun to slow. As such, investorsâ€™ appetite for
risk is returning, and some of the barriers to credit that have been constraining businesses and households are
diminishing.
Income from the federal fiscal stimulus, as well as some improvement in confidence, has helped stabilize consumer spending. Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, this is a key factor
affecting our forecast of growth in the third quarter.
The gradual nature of the recovery will put additional pressure on state and local budgets. Following a difficult
2009, especially in the West, most states began the 2010 fiscal year on July 1 with even larger budget gaps to
solve.
Still, many remain worried that large fiscal deficits will eventually be inflationary. However, a look at the empirical link between fiscal deficits and inflation in the United States shows no correlation between the two. Indeed,
during the 1980s, when the United States was running large deficits, inflation was coming down.
