In early times, no one knew how volcanoes formed or why they spouted red-hot molten rock. In modern times, scientists began to study volcanoes. They still don’t know all the answers, but they know much about how a volcano works. Our planet is made up of many layers of rock. The top layers of solid rock are called the crust. Deep beneath the crust is the mantle, where it is so hot that some rock melts. The melted, or molten, rock is called magma. Volcanoes are formed when magma pushes its way up through the crack in Earth’s crust. This is called a volcanic eruption. When magma pours forth on the surface, it is called lava.
In March 1980, Mount St. Helens awakened from its long sleep. Fust there were a few small earthquakes that shook the mountain. Then, on March 27, Mount St. Helens began to spout ash and steam. Each day brought fit ther earthquakes, until by mid-May more than ten thousand small earthquakes had been recorded. The mountain began to swell up and crack. Sunday, May 18, dawned bright and cleat The mountain seemed much the same as it had been ix the past month. Suddenly, at 8:32 AM., Mount St. Helens erupted with thardiblie force. The enemy released in the eruption was equal to ten million tons of dynamite.
