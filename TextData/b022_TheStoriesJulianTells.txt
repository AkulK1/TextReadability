"I'm going to make something special for your mother," my father said. My mother was out shopping. My father was in the kitchen, looking at the pots and the pans and the jars of this and that. "What are you going to make?" I said. "A pudding," he said. My father is a big man with wild black hair. When he laughs, the sun laughs in the window-panes. When he thinks, you can almost see his thoughts sitting on all the tables and chairs. When he is angry, me and my little brother, Huey, shiver to the bottom of our shoes. "What kind of pudding will you make?" Huey said. "A wonderful pudding," my father said. "It will taste like a whole raft of lemons. It will taste like a night on the sea." Then he took down a knife and sliced five lemons in half. He squeezed the first one. Juice squirted in my eye. "Stand back!" he said, and squeezed again. The seeds flew out on the floor. "Pick up those seeds, Huey!" he said. Huey took the broom and swept them up. My father cracked some eggs and put the yolks in a pan and the whites in a bowl. He rolled up his sleeves and pushed back his hair and beat up the yolks. "Sugar, Julian!" he said, and I poured in the sugar. He went on beating. Then he put in lemon juice and cream and set the pan on the stove. The pudding bubbled and he stirred it fast. Cream splashed on the stove. "Wipe that up, Huey!" he said. Huey did. "If I just put my finger in—there—I'll know how it tastes," Huey said. And he did it. "You did it!" I said. "How does it taste?" "It tastes like a whole raft of lemons," he said. "It castes like a night on the sea." "You've made a hole in the pudding!" I said. "But since you did k, I'll have a taste." And it tasted like a whole night of lemons. It tasted like floating at sea. "It's such a big pudding," Huey said. "It can't hurt to have a little more." "Since you took more, I'll have more," I said. 'That was a bigger lick than I took!" Huey said. "I'm going to have more again." "Whoops!" I said. "You put in your whole hand!" Huey said. "Look at the pudding you spilled on the floor!" "I am going to clean it up," I said. And I took the rag from the sink. "That's not really clean," Huey said. "It's the best I can do," I said. "Look at the pudding!" Huey said. It looked like craters on the moon. "We have to smooth this over," I said. "So it looks the way it did before! Let's get spoons." And we evened the top of the pudding with spoons, and while we evened it, we ate some more. "There isn't much left," I said. "We were supposed to leave the pudding alone," Huey said. "We'd better get away from here," I said. We ran into our bedroom and crawled under the bed. After a long time we heard my father's voice. "Come into the kitchen, dear," he said. "I have something for you." "Why, what is it?" my mother said, out in the kitchen. Under the bed, Huey and I pressed ourselves to the wall. "Look," said my Ether, out in the kitchen. "A wonderful pudding." "Where is the pudding?" my mother said. "WHERE ARE YOU BOYS?" my father said. His voice went through every crack and corner of the house. We felt like two leaves in a storm. "WHERE ARE YOU? I SAID!" My father's voice was booming. Huey whispered to me, "I'm scared." We heard my father walking slowly through the rooms. "Huey!" he called. "Julian!" We could see his feet. He was coming into OM room. He liked the bedspread. There was his face, and his eyes like black lightning. He grabbed us by the legs and pulled. "STAND UP!" he said. We stood.
