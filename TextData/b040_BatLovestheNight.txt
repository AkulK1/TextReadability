Bat is waking, upside down as usual, hanging by her toenails. Her beady eyes open. Her pixie ears twitch. 
She shakes her thistledown fur. 
She unfurls her wings, made of skin so fine the finger bones inside show through. 
Out under the broken tile into the nighttime garden. Over bushes, under trees, between fence posts, through the tangled hedge she swoops untouched. Bat is at home in the darkness as a fish is in the water. She doesn't need to seeâ€”she can hear where she is going. 
Bat shouts as she flies, louder than a hammer blow, higher than a squeak. She beams her voice around her like a flashlight, and the echoes come singing back. They carry a sound picture of all her voice has touched. Listening hard, Bat can hear every detail, the smallest twigs, the shape of leaves. 
Baby bats can't fly. Sometimes mother bats carry their babies when they go out, but mostly the babies stay behind in the roost and crowd together to keep warm. 
Inside, there are squeakings. Fifty hungry batlings hang in a huddle, hooked to a rafter by oversized feet. Bat lands and pushes in among them, toes first, upside down again. 

Baby bats drink mother's milk until they learn to fly at a few weeks old. Then they can leave the roost at night to find their own food. 
Bat knows her baby's voice, and calls to it. The velvet scrap batling climbs aboard and clings to Bat's fur by its coat-hanger feet. Wrapped in her leathery wings, the baby snuggles to sleep.
