A government of our own is our natural right: And when a man seriously reflects on the precariousness of human
affairs, he will become convinced, that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a constitution of our own in a cool
deliberate manner, while we have it in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance. If we
omit it now, some Massenello may hereafter arise, who laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the
desperate and the discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers of government, may sweep away the
liberties of the continent like a deluge. Should the government of America return again into the hands of Britain, the
tottering situation of things, will be a temptation for some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in such a case,
what relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the news the fatal business might be done, and ourselves suffering like
the wretched Britons under the oppression of the Conqueror. Ye that oppose independence now, ye know not what
ye do; ye are opening a door to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government.
