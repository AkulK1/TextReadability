A mother bird sat on her egg.
The egg jumped!
“Oh my!” said mother bird.  “My baby will be here!  He will want to eat!!  I must get him something!”
So away she went.

The egg jumped.  Out came the baby bird!
“Where is my mother?”  he said.  He looked for her.
He looked up / down – did not see her.
“I will go and look for her.”  So away he went.

He came to a kitten. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the kitten.  The kitten just looked and looked.  He did not say a thing.  The kitten was not his mother, so he went on. 

He came to a dog. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the dog.
“I am not your mother.  I am a dog,” said the dog.

The kitten was not his mother.  The dog was not his mother.  So the baby bird went on. 

He came to a cow. 
“Are you my mother?” he said to the cow. 
“How could I be your mother?” said the cow.  “I am a cow.”

The kitten was not his mother.  The dog was not his mother.  The cow was not his mother.  Did he have a mother?

“I do have a mother,” said the baby bird.  “I have to find her!”

The baby bird passed a red car.  Could that thing be his mother? 
Then he saw a boat sailing along.  “There she is!  Mother!”  He called out to the boat.  But the boat did not stop. 
He looked up and saw a plane.  “Here I am, Mother!”  But the plane did not stop. 

Then the baby bird saw a big blue thing could toward him.  This must be his mother!  He ran right up to it.  “Mother!  Mother!  Here I am, Mother!”  But the big thing just said “Snort!”
“You are not my mother.  You are a Snort.  I have to get out of here!”
But the baby bird could not get away.  The snort went up and started moving.  But where was the Snort going? 

“Where am I?” said the baby bird.  “I want to go home!  I want my mother!”
Just then the Snort dropped the baby bird back into the nest.  The baby bird was home!  Just then mother bird came back. 

“Do you know who I am?” she said to her baby.
“Yes, I know who you are.  You are not a kitten.  You are not a dog.  You are not a cow.  You are not a boat, a plane, or a snort.  You are a bird, and you are my mother!”
